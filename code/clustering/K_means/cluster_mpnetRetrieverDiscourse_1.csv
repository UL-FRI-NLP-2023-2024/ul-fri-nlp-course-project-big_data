"given the two terrible choices,",Seminar
"I would imagine,",Seminar
"However, I also do not",Seminar
I agree with Ashely ,Seminar

I'm overall a little confused by this entire module ,Deliberation
and am open to other thoughts/suggestions.,Deliberation
"I think you are correct, Ashley. ",Deliberation
"That sounds great, Meg! ",Social

I'm not sure! ,Procedure
I couldn't either.,Procedure
Good idea!,Social
So how do you guys think we should end it?,Deliberation
"I'm honestly okay with either ending, ",Deliberation
That's just my opinion though.,Seminar
"Of course, we should all definitely have a chance to contribute.",Procedure
I liked what you mentioned earlier Kyra,Seminar
But that's just what I was thinking.,Seminar
 I'm definitely okay with another approach that we can all agree on,Seminar
And I almost think if we can't decide we might just flip a coin ,Seminar
(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing),Social

That's exactly what I think as well.,Seminar
