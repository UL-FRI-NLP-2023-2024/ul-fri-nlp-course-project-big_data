of the author's word choice of barbarism.,Seminar
"Her lover would die and never love another."" ",Seminar
"Either way she must love without him, but is she open-hearted enough to allow for him to love another?",Seminar
"It doesn't appear so. For instance, she discloses great agony, jealousy, and stress about the potential wedding between her lover and the lady behind the door;",Seminar
"more upset with the prospect of him belonging to another, and so it is clear,",Seminar
she would send him to his death.,Seminar
"given that it is stressed he is semi-barbaric, he would choose not to send his daughter, whom he loves so dearly, to her potential death.",Seminar
imagine this to be the catalyst that ends his idea of public punishment. ,Seminar
The story also leads me to think that she is accustomed to having her every wish granted by her father and that she never learned the benefits of compassion.,Seminar
"If the secret was shared with the community, I also think that it would be her informant that would be punished.",Seminar
I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an ,Seminar
Love does have a way of changing how we think and make valuable decisions like this one,Seminar
"While Jealousy is a strong determinate, Love is often stronger, and it would make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make",Seminar
make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make sense for her to have him killed. ,Seminar
Basing a decision on her lineage is not exactly a strong source in my opinion.,Seminar
"However, basing a decision on her own thought process, that I can get behind",Seminar
had great grief over her lover in another’s arms.,Seminar
"As for the second part, only her lover saw her give the signal so the second part is questionable as it would be based on hearsay. ",Seminar
"Without someone seeing her give the signal, they really cannot accuse her of helping him",Seminar
"Not to mention that if she had not helped him at all, and he opened the door with the female, would she still be under scrutiny?",Seminar
" In the story  it is mentioned several times that the princess is jealous of the idea of her lover being with another woman  stating ""her soul had burned in agony when he rushed to meet that woman"" (pp. 10).",Seminar
This action seems indicitive of her barbaric and jealous nature because this way she remains the conquerer  and if she cannot,Seminar
Do you think that she kills him or saves him?,Seminar
What would you do in her place?,Imaginative entry
"I kind of think that even though she is angry and jealous, she would ultimately save him. ",Seminar
I think that overall the weight of her conscious would have kept her from sending him to his death for falling in love with her.,Seminar
Perhaps he planned it so that she would be the one to make the decision in the end as no one has ever known what's behind the doors before,Seminar
Maybe this was her punishment.,Seminar
"Knowing she could save him from death, but still lose him in the end.",Seminar
I'm kind of on the fence about whether she saves him or not.,Seminar
 I think that she may dislike the idea that he marries another more than him dying.,Seminar
Emilie I can see that. ,Seminar
What would you do in her place?,Imaginative entry
"Not what do you think she would do, but what would you do if you were in the situation? ",Imaginative entry
I know I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I was the reason the person I loved was killed in such a painful manner,Imaginative entry
 It would hurt worse to know his death was my fault than to know that he was happy with someone else. ,Imaginative entry
I think I'd find it easier to move on and live if he was still alive.,Imaginative entry
" Personally, I would save him. ",Imaginative entry
"I'd rather be sad for a little while that the person I loved married someone else, than let them get killed. ",Imaginative entry
I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.,Imaginative entry
I'm sure I would eventually get over him being with someone else,Imaginative entry
"How do you think it should end, Emilie?",Seminar
about how she may have felt guilty.,Seminar
He sentences her to the same trial.,Seminar
 The abyss of pain and betrayal of an unfaithful lover and seeing them with someone else is palpable and I could imagine that in the throngs of that deep pain one might wish their unfaithful lover to be dead.,Seminar
"I think the lady is behind the door. If she truly loved him as the story seems to claim, she would not have wanted him mauled. Plus, if she wants a future with any man she wouldn’t want the world to see her first lover as someone who deserved to be punished.",Seminar
I think she may not trust him enough to give him the door with the lady behind it. They really focused on her jealousy and how she's a lot like her father.,Seminar
She's definitely her father's child.,Seminar
"I think it would depend on how much she truly trust her lover. If she had faith in him truly, she would let him live with the lady. At least he would be alive and happy. But if she was full of distrust or jealousy she would kill her lover. Even if she is semi-barbaric she seems to be fair or at least a follower of her Father. I would say she would point to the Lady in the end.",Seminar
I agree he will forgive his daughter because he loves her so.,Seminar
"Live without was the first one I put.  Then Trust, Love, and then Know",Deliberation
Live Without Him is probably the most important question,Deliberation
I feel like it would be the opposite because she went to all the hassle to find out.,Seminar
I am under the impression that she would rather see him dead than in the arms of another woman.,Seminar
keeping one's orbs in line is essential,Seminar
or maybe he put her behind one of the doors!,Seminar
Oh that would be a good punishment for her!,Seminar
I know live without him,Deliberation
since she will lose him anyway*,Seminar
"lol no, it just seemed like what happened based on her father, and her own jealous nature",Seminar
"Yes, she did seem very jealous. The story led me to believe she would rather nobody have him if she could not.",Seminar
"I think so. Even though the story said he loved her so much, I think his barbaric nature would take over his reasoning",Seminar
"I think it's barbaric nature but also slightly just (in a warped way), because as it mentions he treated women and men equally so would feel obliged to treat his daughter the same",Seminar
Should we mention that love didn't weigh in to either of their decisions?,Seminar
"I'm not sure how to word it, but I think their barbaric nature made them irrational and maybe incapable of love? Something like that...",Seminar
"Maybe not to enough of a degree not to put her to trial...but he does love her, just like to a degree she loved the man",Seminar
He was tied to his own idealistic principles?,Seminar
I don't think the father would put his daughter through the same system of justice. I wonder if he would even be all the upset though - because either way he is rid of the man causing him problems - either to death or to be married off to someone else.,Seminar
I think he would be upset...even just for the fact that her behavior is a bad reflection on him. He sounds very narcissistic so I dont know if he would feel real love for his daughter but her behavior and a public trial would bruise his ego. That in itself would be enough for him to brush her crimes under the carpet.,Seminar
 but maybe he's the only one who knows what she did?,Seminar
"Part 1: What Happens next...I believe in love overall.  I believe she chose to love him by giving him life and happiness.  This is what love truly is.  The story describes her as jovial.  Although her father appears quite selfish, he adores her which means she has seen true love.  So, out comes the lady.",Seminar
"Maybe I'm a skeptic, but I'm not convinced she sends him on to live his happily ever after with another woman.  There's a whole paragraph on the last page about how the whole idea of that tormented here. And she asks Would it not be better for him to die at once  and go to wait for her in the blessed regions of semi-barbaric futurity?""",Seminar
"Part 2: Her father gets extremely upset with her for signaling her lover behind his back. He then forgives her because she has proven to be as strong as the rest of her family. Understanding that if she can't have him, no else can't either.",Seminar
Marry the girl not the man.,Seminar
"I enjoyed reading all of your perspectives.  Nicole Gonzalez- I also found the idea of barbarism"" kind of unsettling... I guess it was a pretty common theme in story telling in the ""old  but reading from my 21st century perspective days""  it feels like labeling the society as ""other"" or ""bad"".""",Seminar
"Hi Teresa Stewart, I felt that if he truly knew her, he would know her true character and her barbaric side. The story also noted that she had seen her lover talk to the lady before, and assumed that her jealousy would be known to him prior to his tribunal.",Seminar
"If she really loves him, she should want him to be with someone else and alive rather than dead!",Seminar
I had to ask my spouse for help,Social
I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?,Seminar
There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?,Seminar
