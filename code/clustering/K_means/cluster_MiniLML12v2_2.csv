"Her lover would die and never love another."" ",Seminar
"Either way she must love without him, but is she open-hearted enough to allow for him to love another?",Seminar
"It doesn't appear so. For instance, she discloses great agony, jealousy, and stress about the potential wedding between her lover and the lady behind the door;",Seminar
"however, she only comments that a tiger would bring shrieks and blood. From her revealed thoughts, she is ",Seminar
"more upset with the prospect of him belonging to another, and so it is clear,",Seminar
she would send him to his death.,Seminar
"given that it is stressed he is semi-barbaric, he would choose not to send his daughter, whom he loves so dearly, to her potential death.",Seminar
"Perhaps, instead of sending his daughter to the arena, he would send the person who gave her the information about the two doors instead.",Seminar
"She exhibits immaturity and cruelty by fixating on imagined flirtations between ""the lady"" and the princess's lover.",Seminar
The story also leads me to think that she is accustomed to having her every wish granted by her father and that she never learned the benefits of compassion.,Seminar
"If the secret was shared with the community, I also think that it would be her informant that would be punished.",Seminar
Love does have a way of changing how we think and make valuable decisions like this one,Seminar
"While Jealousy is a strong determinate, Love is often stronger, and it would make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make",Seminar
make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make sense for her to have him killed. ,Seminar
Basing a decision on her lineage is not exactly a strong source in my opinion.,Seminar
"However, basing a decision on her own thought process, that I can get behind",Seminar
had great grief over her lover in anotherâ€™s arms.,Seminar
"As for the second part, only her lover saw her give the signal so the second part is questionable as it would be based on hearsay. ",Seminar
"Without someone seeing her give the signal, they really cannot accuse her of helping him",Seminar
"Not to mention that if she had not helped him at all, and he opened the door with the female, would she still be under scrutiny?",Seminar
" In the story  it is mentioned several times that the princess is jealous of the idea of her lover being with another woman  stating ""her soul had burned in agony when he rushed to meet that woman"" (pp. 10).",Seminar
This action seems indicitive of her barbaric and jealous nature because this way she remains the conquerer  and if she cannot,Seminar
Do you think that she kills him or saves him?,Seminar
What would you do in her place?,Imaginative entry
"I kind of think that even though she is angry and jealous, she would ultimately save him. ",Seminar
I think that overall the weight of her conscious would have kept her from sending him to his death for falling in love with her.,Seminar
Perhaps he planned it so that she would be the one to make the decision in the end as no one has ever known what's behind the doors before,Seminar
Maybe this was her punishment.,Seminar
"Knowing she could save him from death, but still lose him in the end.",Seminar
I'm kind of on the fence about whether she saves him or not.,Seminar
 I think that she may dislike the idea that he marries another more than him dying.,Seminar
So I'm leaning more toward she sends him to the tiger's door.,Seminar
What would you do in her place?,Imaginative entry
"Not what do you think she would do, but what would you do if you were in the situation? ",Imaginative entry
I know I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I was the reason the person I loved was killed in such a painful manner,Imaginative entry
 It would hurt worse to know his death was my fault than to know that he was happy with someone else. ,Imaginative entry
" Personally, I would save him. ",Imaginative entry
"I'd rather be sad for a little while that the person I loved married someone else, than let them get killed. ",Imaginative entry
"There are other guys out there so even if he was the most handsome and all that,",Imaginative entry
I'm sure I would eventually get over him being with someone else,Imaginative entry
"I think if I misled him to choose the tiger's door, I would feel like I committed a murder myself",Imaginative entry
"I also got the sense that she would point her lover to the tiger's door, but now the more that I think about it, I think she would send him to the other woman.",Seminar
about how she may have felt guilty.,Seminar
"BUT, he'd tell her which door leads to a man and which leads to the tiger, thinking that she will obviously choose to marry and live.",Seminar
"HOWEVER, she is so distraught about losing the love of her life that she actually chooses the tiger's door on purpose.",Seminar
Oooo I like that idea of how he might send her to the arena and then tell her which is behind each door. ,Seminar
"This gives her a chance at potential happiness or, if she is feeling miserable and depressed, may want to go through with the tiger!",Seminar
He sentences her to the same trial.,Seminar
 The abyss of pain and betrayal of an unfaithful lover and seeing them with someone else is palpable and I could imagine that in the throngs of that deep pain one might wish their unfaithful lover to be dead.,Seminar
"I think the lady is behind the door. If she truly loved him as the story seems to claim, she would not have wanted him mauled. Plus, if she wants a future with any man she wouldnâ€™t want the world to see her first lover as someone who deserved to be punished.",Seminar
"I think the lady is behind the door. Regardless of how jealous you may be, you can't really love someone and also be able to tolerate watching them get torn apart by a wild animal.",Seminar
"Anna Jones, this is what I was thinking. If you really loved him you wouldnâ€™t allow that. Alexandra, I was leaning toward the tiger at first because of the descriptions you gave. The apple doesnâ€™t fall far from the tree and all that. ðŸ™‚",Seminar
She gifted him with the tiger.,Seminar
I think she may not trust him enough to give him the door with the lady behind it. They really focused on her jealousy and how she's a lot like her father.,Seminar
She's definitely her father's child.,Seminar
Could she be fed to the tiger and save the unsuspecting poor fool?,Seminar
"I think it would depend on how much she truly trust her lover. If she had faith in him truly, she would let him live with the lady. At least he would be alive and happy. But if she was full of distrust or jealousy she would kill her lover. Even if she is semi-barbaric she seems to be fair or at least a follower of her Father. I would say she would point to the Lady in the end.",Seminar
"Interesting Jennifer Gonzalez that I initially thought the Tiger because of her jealousy and that if she could not have him, then no one could have him. But, I changed my mind with the hope of a happier ending.",Seminar
I agree he will forgive his daughter because he loves her so.,Seminar
Live Without Him is probably the most important question,Deliberation
I feel like it would be the opposite because she went to all the hassle to find out.,Seminar
I am under the impression that she would rather see him dead than in the arms of another woman.,Seminar
or maybe he put her behind one of the doors!,Seminar
Oh that would be a good punishment for her!,Seminar
I know live without him,Deliberation
"I believe she tells him to open the door with the tiger. This isn't a question of whether or not she loves him, or even trusts him. It's clearly written that she loves him dearly, and his trustworthiness isn't something to consider so heavily since she will lose him heavily. I think she points him to the tiger because of how much more thought she put into the aftermath of sending him towards the lady. She laments on how horrifying it would be to watch her loved one die at the hands of ferocity, but laments even more at the thought of watching him live a different life with someone other than her. She even gives his death a hopeful spin, that they may meet again in the afterlife or some equivalent, but gives no optimistic spin to him choosing the lady, she even mentions the whole if she can't have him no one can.""""",Seminar
since she will lose him anyway*,Seminar
"I agree with you ladies. I also think that she sends him to the tiger. She loves him fiercely, so fiercely that she cannot bear the thought of someone else having him. Jealousy can make people do ugly things and mix that in with her pure barbaric nature, it makes sense that she would choose for him to stop living versus living with someone else. Mourning would be easier than seeing the person you love happy with another, which is clear by the ways she describes her thoughts and turmoil over the situation.",Seminar
"But I think he would also revel in the fact that his daughter could be so barbaric. However, he does seem to hold the random chance of fate of the arena in the highest regard so although he loves his daughter above all else I think he may make an example of her. Especially if the people found out what happened",Seminar
"No problem. :) So to jump right in, when I read I felt like she sent him to the door with the tiger.",Seminar
"lol no, it just seemed like what happened based on her father, and her own jealous nature",Seminar
"Yes, she did seem very jealous. The story led me to believe she would rather nobody have him if she could not.",Seminar
"from my thoughts I thought yes, he sets up 2 doors for her and lets the trial decide.",Seminar
"I think so. Even though the story said he loved her so much, I think his barbaric nature would take over his reasoning",Seminar
"Ok, so what happens then? Do we choose which door she opens?",Deliberation
"I think it's barbaric nature but also slightly just (in a warped way), because as it mentions he treated women and men equally so would feel obliged to treat his daughter the same",Seminar
Should we mention that love didn't weigh in to either of their decisions?,Seminar
"I'm not sure how to word it, but I think their barbaric nature made them irrational and maybe incapable of love? Something like that...",Seminar
"Maybe not to enough of a degree not to put her to trial...but he does love her, just like to a degree she loved the man",Seminar
I think she sends him to to the tiger. She could live with his death but not with him living with another woman.,Seminar
 I think she sends him to the tiger. Its clear she had jealousy issues and she was raised by a father that is erratic and delivers justice according to a whim. I dont think she would think reasonably.,Seminar
I don't think the father would put his daughter through the same system of justice. I wonder if he would even be all the upset though - because either way he is rid of the man causing him problems - either to death or to be married off to someone else.,Seminar
I think he would be upset...even just for the fact that her behavior is a bad reflection on him. He sounds very narcissistic so I dont know if he would feel real love for his daughter but her behavior and a public trial would bruise his ego. That in itself would be enough for him to brush her crimes under the carpet.,Seminar
 but maybe he's the only one who knows what she did?,Seminar
"Part 1: What Happens next...I believe in love overall.  I believe she chose to love him by giving him life and happiness.  This is what love truly is.  The story describes her as jovial.  Although her father appears quite selfish, he adores her which means she has seen true love.  So, out comes the lady.",Seminar
"This is such an unfortunate story. It looks to me that no matter the choice, all parties will be unhappy. I'd like to think that even though she did inherit some of her dad's fury, she would still try to give her lover a chance and not pick the door with the tiger. Perhaps, she doesn't want to be as cruel as her father, and in the name of love, sacrificed her fate to allow her lover to live. I agree with some of your sentiments about the obsession and control the father holds over his daughter. She has ",Seminar
"I think the story is supposed to be a 'it's up to interpretation' kind of ending, but in a way that purposefully leads you to believe that she sends him to the tiger. But that feels like such a shallow stereotype of a jealous woman. The story talks a lot about how they understand each other fully, without needing to speak, so I thought that she pointed him toward the door with the woman (her sacrifice, letting him be happy without her), but he knew that and purposefully chose the tiger (his sacrifice, not ",Seminar
"Maybe I'm a skeptic, but I'm not convinced she sends him on to live his happily ever after with another woman.  There's a whole paragraph on the last page about how the whole idea of that tormented here. And she asks Would it not be better for him to die at once  and go to wait for her in the blessed regions of semi-barbaric futurity?""",Seminar
I still think she sent him to the tiger!,Seminar
I believe she sent him to the tiger.  A king's daughter would not want to share a lover or see him with another woman.,Seminar
"Part 1: I think that she guided him to the tiger. She was already jealous, and if she couldn't have him, then no one should.",Seminar
"Part 2: Her father gets extremely upset with her for signaling her lover behind his back. He then forgives her because she has proven to be as strong as the rest of her family. Understanding that if she can't have him, no else can't either.",Seminar
 in being conflicted by happily ever after and greed. I chose the tiger behind the door because the story paints her out to be extremely jealous and barbaric.,Seminar
Marry the girl not the man.,Seminar
"Part One con't: Oops, sent the rest before finishing this thought. I think the lover goes to the door on the left instead of the door on the right, thinking on her barbaric"" nature and that she'd likely betray him  and finds a lady instead of the tiger. I'm assuming even though he knows her  it would leave him in shock knowing that the Princess would want him dead if she cannot keep him to herself.""",Seminar
"Hi Teresa Stewart, I felt that if he truly knew her, he would know her true character and her barbaric side. The story also noted that she had seen her lover talk to the lady before, and assumed that her jealousy would be known to him prior to his tribunal.",Seminar
"If she really loves him, she should want him to be with someone else and alive rather than dead!",Seminar
It was strange because it seems the daughter is jealous of the lady behind the door. so its an interesting twist,Seminar
I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :),Seminar
"I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.",Seminar
Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(,Seminar
"If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.",Seminar
I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?,Seminar
There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?,Seminar
"Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy",Seminar
"I certainly hoped that she was steering her lover away from the tiger, but can see how she would not want to see him with another woman based on the jealousy discussed above.",Seminar
