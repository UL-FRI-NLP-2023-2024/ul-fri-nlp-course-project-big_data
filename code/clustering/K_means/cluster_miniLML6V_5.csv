Thanks for taking the lead on the first draft,Social

Do we know how many people are part of this group? ,Procedure
We can try to get in touch with them and decide how we wat to write out the answer,Procedure
"I tried looking for a ""particpants"" button or something and I couldn't find one.",Procedure
"I sent an email to the coordinator and I hope to hear back from them, but I wouldn't mind setting up a discussion in our class page too",Procedure
You're here for LIS6303 or for another class?,Procedure
I'm also in LIS6303!,Procedure
okay awesome! ,Procedure
I'm going to create a discussion called Book Club 4 and see if we can see if there is anyone else who is part of that group.,Procedure

"Kyra, I LOVE what you did for part 1!! ",Social
Let's hope I do as well on part 2!!,Social
Awww thank you so much!,Social
Finished! How does that sound?,Seminar
it's wonderful!,Seminar
Any idea on how to submit it?,UX
Yeah I was wondering because when I click 'My Answer' at the top it says I haven't submitted one. ,UX
Maybe sometime next week there will be a button to push.,UX
Or when the survey comes out maybe something will be there,UX
"Hi John, ",Social
"Unfortunately I can't click in the box below at all, so it's anyone's guess what style our response is supposed to be in. I would imagine answering the questions simply would be fine.",UX
"Oh good! I can, in fact, click in the box.",UX
Great!,UX
Looks good. I think to mark our assignment done we just have to write SUBMITTED at the top of the entry.,UX
"Karen Richardson,",Seminar
Wait how do we submit this assignment?,Deliberation
"So the top is for chatting and the bottom is for responding, I believe.",Deliberation
Yes I found this by luck...LOL!,Deliberation
"Ok, I had to reset the book to make this work!",Deliberation
Yay you got it!,"Social, Deliberation"
"Yep, so what you think the questions are?",Deliberation
Which questions? like the prompt?,Deliberation
But it asked for 4 so i amswered with 4,Deliberation
ok,Deliberation
"At the top of the screen are two questions, I believe that is what the 1 & 2 are on the bottom portion",Deliberation
I tried the ones you mentioned it said try again.,Deliberation
You have to do them one at a time,Deliberation
me too. It said wrong!,Deliberation
I'm try again.,Deliberation
ok!,Deliberation
Any additions?,Deliberation
Hey guys I got through the next page,Deliberation
Did you guys get the final question,Deliberation
im just back at the screen we were at before,UX
"Does anyone have any idea how to ""add the title SUBMITTED"" to our response?",UX
i do not,UX
Also feel free to add anything to them if you would like.,Deliberation
Submitted,Deliberation
What did you have to do?,Deliberation
I just added a title submitted so I guess we're done. This was very interesting and challenging.,Deliberation
lol well ok then. Nice work team,Deliberation
Don't forget we have to go on to canvas and complete the survey and submit it,Deliberation
Thank you team!  Nice collab!,Social
"Sounds good, I am going to get off of here.",Social
Nice work team,Social
have a great evening!,Social
Me too goodnight! Thanks guys!,Social
"We can continue to discuss individually, or if you want to try writing collaboratively at the same time, please suggest a time. I'm available any evening this week starting at 6 p.m. I'll keep tabs on here from now on to see if you want to do that. Thanks, Robyn",Procedure
"Since we have each answered the two questions that were proposed, maybe choosing a day/time to all discuss our final answer to the prompt would be best. I am pretty flexible and am available today-thursday just about all day.",Procedure
"Dr. Austin said have fun with it, and it is fun to ponder what might happen in the story. I think the main reason for setting a time to discuss it at the same time would be to test the collaborative software, using the box below instead of this one. I believe we could all write in it at the same time and see each other typing and change each other's words until we all agree we are done with our assessment. If we are able to do that, we might find there are unexpected positives or negatives to the collaboration process or system that we can only otherwise surmise. As you say, we've all responded to the prompts, so what we say doesn't matter that much, so all we'd need is a few minutes to see how using the box works. So if you want to try meeting, I could do Wednesday any time of day. Just set a time and I'll log on then. Thanks.",Procedure
I can meet tomorrow (Wednesday) at 9am EST/8CST.,Procedure
Good morning. I'm here.,Social
Good morning,Social
Do you see what I typed in the box below?,Procedure
I did this assignment twice last semester. I think they are just trying to get feedback on how it works/doesn't work. If the prompts and/or grouping is sufficient.,Procedure
"Yes, I see it. It looks great",Procedure
"Oh, yay! Can you type a few words in there so I can see if they appear in real time? Then I think we can sign off.",Procedure
"Sorry, i see you comment now.",Procedure
"Thanks. I apologize for delaying you on completing this assignment, but I appreciate your taking the extra time for me. Good luck with the rest of the semester!",Social
Looks good! I guess we can complete the post survey and submit our assignment,"Social, Procedure"
Good luck to you as well,Social
Yes. Thanks. Bye!,Social
Sounds good!,Social
Hi everyone! I have read the story and am ready to discuss.  I can log back in later to see if anyone else is ready.  Should we try to figure out a time to all come back and work in here together?,Procedure
"Hi Patricia Green and Michelle Rivera,",Social
"Apologies for my slacking with this, I am also finished now.",Social
Can we plan on Tuesday the 23rd at 8pm to all meet back here to discuss and answer? Thanks,Procedure
"I just replied to the email, but yes"" I can meet back here tomorrow (Tues. at 8pm). ""See"" you all then!""",Procedure
"Hi Linda Long and Michelle Rivera, I am here and ready whenever you both are.",Procedure
"I am on,",Procedure
"So, we discuss the prompt here and then write it together in the box below?",Procedure
"Ok, that's how I understand it as well. Let's wait a few more minutes to give Julie a chance to join us. Sound good?",Procedure
How much longer would you like to wait for Julie before we begin? 5 more minutes?,Procedure
"If you can I can, or we could start and she could catch up?",Procedure
"I hope she's not back on one of the earlier pages, I just went back to reference and clicked the discussion and was left with a blank page, all these messages were not there.",Procedure
"Perfect, we are all here.",Procedure
Sorry for the delay,Social
"Ok, that works for me. We can just answer the questions.",Deliberation

"So, we title it SUBMITTED and that's it, right?",Deliberation
