that the emphasis on barbarism implies that she sent him to the lion.,Seminar
"If the princess possesses the same semi-barbaric trait as her father, then it would seem she directed her lover to the door with the tiger. ",Seminar
"however, she only comments that a tiger would bring shrieks and blood. From her revealed thoughts, she is ",Seminar
and Meg brought and interesting topic of the difference between how the princess rambles on about him opening the door with the lady but barely mentions him opening the door with the tiger.,Seminar
"Part 1: For this question, our team decided that the princess chose the door with the tiger. ",Seminar
So I'm leaning more toward she sends him to the tiger's door.,Seminar
"I think if I misled him to choose the tiger's door, I would feel like I committed a murder myself",Imaginative entry
"I also got the sense that she would point her lover to the tiger's door, but now the more that I think about it, I think she would send him to the other woman.",Seminar
"BUT, he'd tell her which door leads to a man and which leads to the tiger, thinking that she will obviously choose to marry and live.",Seminar
"HOWEVER, she is so distraught about losing the love of her life that she actually chooses the tiger's door on purpose.",Seminar
"This gives her a chance at potential happiness or, if she is feeling miserable and depressed, may want to go through with the tiger!",Seminar
"Oooo I have another idea! What if the princess sends the man to the tiger and right out tells her father she did it and wants a trial. Then because he loves her he begs her to choose the door with the young man he picks for her, but she chooses the tiger.",Seminar
Part 1: It is such an agonizing question of whether the lady or the tiger is behind the door. ,Seminar
"The text describes the anxiety of being in a huge stadium with a roaring crowd and the fear of being killed horribly by a tiger, ",Seminar
The King does seem unstable enough to put his daughter on trial via the lady and the tiger method. I imagine she'd use her own connections to find out which door had the tiger behind it and which door had a suitor.,Seminar
"I think the tiger was behind the door. Mostly because of the princess being described as ""hot-blooded and semi-barbaric.""",Seminar
"Anna Jones, this is what I was thinking. If you really loved him you wouldnâ€™t allow that. Alexandra, I was leaning toward the tiger at first because of the descriptions you gave. The apple doesnâ€™t fall far from the tree and all that. ðŸ™‚",Seminar
"So, where have we landed: Lady or tiger? Trial or coverup? I think we just have to write something in the space below.","Seminar, Deliberation"
She gifted him with the tiger.,Seminar
Could she be fed to the tiger and save the unsuspecting poor fool?,Seminar
The king fed his daughter to the tiger,Seminar
"I want to believe the tiger was behind the door because the princess was semi-barbaric but she was also filled with despair and jealousy.  The green eyed monster.. gets you every time...so she knows she has lost him, but she doesn't have to let the Lady have him.",Seminar
"Interesting Jennifer Gonzalez that I initially thought the Tiger because of her jealousy and that if she could not have him, then no one could have him. But, I changed my mind with the hope of a happier ending.",Seminar
"I believe the lady was behind the door as the description of the princess was ""semi-barbaric."" She could probably have the new couple banished from the kingdom so she would not have to see them. I believe it was the tiger because the princess could not bear for anyone else to have him.",Seminar
"Oh I see, there are two questions here.  I feel that the princess would have led him to the tiger","Deliberation, Seminar"
"I think the tiger is behind the door, as it would create a plot twist when its not the predictable lady. The king may show mercy towards his daughter, as she is royalty. Instead, she might have to go on a quest of some kind to prove her worth to inherit the thrown one day.",Seminar
"I agree with you, Diane Gonzalez. I am convinced that the princess lead the gentleman to the door hiding the tiger. It would make a brilliant plot twist, but with the information we know about the character of the King, that can be found within the princess as well. In my mind she believes if she can't have the man, she sure does not want another woman to have him, especially someone she despises.",Seminar
"Hi Diane Gonzalez and Deborah Evans. I'm sorry to be so late joining the conversation. If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice",Seminar
"Curiosity got the best of me, and I googled this book, which I'd never heard of despite it being a well-known allegory. It presents an unsolvable problem, yet we all felt pretty confident taking a stab at answering the prompts. I wonder what we are to make of all of us feeling pretty certain the princess chose the tiger. Is our choice based on the author's characterization of her or our belief that human nature is fundamentally selfish?",Seminar
I  think she sends him to the door with the tiger. When the king finds out that she knew he is so pleased by her barbarism that he does nothing but inside he has now decided that she is a worthy predecessor.,Seminar
"I believe she tells him to open the door with the tiger. This isn't a question of whether or not she loves him, or even trusts him. It's clearly written that she loves him dearly, and his trustworthiness isn't something to consider so heavily since she will lose him heavily. I think she points him to the tiger because of how much more thought she put into the aftermath of sending him towards the lady. She laments on how horrifying it would be to watch her loved one die at the hands of ferocity, but laments even more at the thought of watching him live a different life with someone other than her. She even gives his death a hopeful spin, that they may meet again in the afterlife or some equivalent, but gives no optimistic spin to him choosing the lady, she even mentions the whole if she can't have him no one can.""""",Seminar
"In terms of just answering I feel like the tiger was behind the door, and later the King puts the daughter to trial...",Seminar
"No problem. :) So to jump right in, when I read I felt like she sent him to the door with the tiger.",Seminar
"Ok, we all thought the tiger!",Seminar
I think she sends him to to the tiger. She could live with his death but not with him living with another woman.,Seminar
 I think she sends him to the tiger. Its clear she had jealousy issues and she was raised by a father that is erratic and delivers justice according to a whim. I dont think she would think reasonably.,Seminar
"This is such an unfortunate story. It looks to me that no matter the choice, all parties will be unhappy. I'd like to think that even though she did inherit some of her dad's fury, she would still try to give her lover a chance and not pick the door with the tiger. Perhaps, she doesn't want to be as cruel as her father, and in the name of love, sacrificed her fate to allow her lover to live. I agree with some of your sentiments about the obsession and control the father holds over his daughter. She has ",Seminar
"I think the story is supposed to be a 'it's up to interpretation' kind of ending, but in a way that purposefully leads you to believe that she sends him to the tiger. But that feels like such a shallow stereotype of a jealous woman. The story talks a lot about how they understand each other fully, without needing to speak, so I thought that she pointed him toward the door with the woman (her sacrifice, letting him be happy without her), but he knew that and purposefully chose the tiger (his sacrifice, not ",Seminar
I still think she sent him to the tiger!,Seminar
"Part 1
I believe that the lady will be behind the doors. I think that the Princess loved her lover too much to allow him to be eaten by the Tiger. She would rather see him out and about the kingdom happy with someone else then torn into pieces by the tiger.  However, I am a divorced mom of two kids and my interpretation might be a little off, since I always wanted and are still looking for that fairy tale kind of ending. The one where true love exists no matter what the couple faces.

Part 2
I believe that",Seminar
Part 1  I believe that the tiger is behind the door.  I think the princess is barbaric and can't stand the thought of her lover with another.,Seminar
Part 1  I believe the tiger will be behind the door.  I think the princess is barbaric and won't be able to stand her lover with another.,Seminar
Part 2  I believe that the king will punish his daughter.  I'm not sure how.  I think it depends on whether the tiger or the woman comes out of the door.  Perhaps he might even make her choose a door.,Seminar
I believe she sent him to the tiger.  A king's daughter would not want to share a lover or see him with another woman.,Seminar
"Part 1: I think that she guided him to the tiger. She was already jealous, and if she couldn't have him, then no one should.",Seminar
 in being conflicted by happily ever after and greed. I chose the tiger behind the door because the story paints her out to be extremely jealous and barbaric.,Seminar
"I agree with you Lillian Flores about it depending on someone, but I feel that it is up to the person reading the story and reflecting on the actions of the characters. In this case, the princess was jealous of the girl and she was also semi-barbaric like her father, so I feel she would have chosen the door with the tiger for the man. If I go with my own emotions, even though the author said not to base it on that, I would think that the princess would make the right choice with the right door and let him marry the man.  Although, would the man trust the princess enough and choose the same door as she indicated? So behind the right door would be the tiger.  They are both semibarbaric, so the King would most likely be disappointed at first, but either way, he got what he wanted and that was to keep his daughter away from this man. In this case, either sentence would be justice in his eyes.",Seminar
"I agree with both of you. To me, it is more likely that the princess would tell the man to open the door to the tiger. There was no mention of the princess questioning the morality of sending him to his death. In fact, it appeared like she was leaning towards it as the more merciful option because he would have a quick death and then be waiting for her in the afterlife. I think if she was going to send him to the other lady, she would have shown more guilt over the option of the tiger.",Seminar
"Part One: The princess seemed more threatened and bothered by the image of her lover going into the arms of another, than by the image of a tiger tearing him apart. I don't remember her exact words, but she thinks him dying quickly if the tiger is behind the door is a better fate for him. I'm not a fan of the barbaric ancestry and tendencies this text brings up, but it seems to be given as the reason for the King and Princess to act cruel and savagely. Therefore, I do think that that behind the door the Princess motioned to is the tiger. The story reads to me as if the Princess would rather have her lover to herself in perpetuity (in her mind) by killing him off now instead of see him with someone else.",Seminar
"Part One con't: Oops, sent the rest before finishing this thought. I think the lover goes to the door on the left instead of the door on the right, thinking on her barbaric"" nature and that she'd likely betray him  and finds a lady instead of the tiger. I'm assuming even though he knows her  it would leave him in shock knowing that the Princess would want him dead if she cannot keep him to herself.""",Seminar
"Part one: I think the lover follows the Princess's instructions and opens the door on the right to the tiger. Based on how the Princess is described as barbaric"" like her father  I think the King sends his daughter into the tribunal as well. He seems set in his ways and seems to value power over logic."" and how she struggles between the two options of leading him to his death or leading him to a life. Part two: as mentioned earlier",Seminar
"So it definitely seems like the princess hates the lady behind the door. But if it were me, I couldn't stand to see the man I love being eaten by a tiger.",Seminar
"I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.",Seminar
"I certainly hoped that she was steering her lover away from the tiger, but can see how she would not want to see him with another woman based on the jealousy discussed above.",Seminar
"Though, I do think it would have been particularly interesting to see her point him to the tiger, just for the tiger to not eat him by some stroke of luck. Perhaps the universe truly showing that the innocent go unpunished in this king's model of justice",Seminar
