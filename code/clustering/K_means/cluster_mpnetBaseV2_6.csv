" Sadly  the barbaric nature of the king and princess is still alive today in crimes of passion.""",Seminar
If the King were to discover that his daughter broke the law by secretly sending her lover towards the door on the right,Seminar
he would have to send his daughter to the arena for a judgement. ,Seminar
"given that it is stressed he is semi-barbaric, he would choose not to send his daughter, whom he loves so dearly, to her potential death.",Seminar
 It could be argued that the informant is more guilty than the princess and is sent to show the kingdom the consequence of such behaviors.,Seminar
 that the Princess's barbaric traits will lead the princess to send her lover to his death.,Seminar
that the king's adoration of his daughter would stop him from sending his daughter into the arena.,Seminar
"I had orgininally thought that the king would either keep her secret out of love for his daughter, or out of barbaric pride that she sent her lover to his grizzly death, or a combination of the two. ",Seminar
Just because she comes from a semi-barbaric King does not make her semi-barbaric. ,Seminar
The princess has no qualms about her lover dying but,Seminar
 Would the king even entertain that idea given it is his daughter?,Seminar
"This is based on the story's emphasis on the royal family's semi barbaric"" nature.",Seminar
This action seems indicitive of her barbaric and jealous nature because this way she remains the conquerer  and if she cannot,Seminar
"After all, it is a two way road and she is being punished right along with him for getting caught by the king as well.",Seminar
 I also think that even if the king finds out that she knew the doors he will know that either choice that she makes is a punishment in its own right. She suffers either way ,Seminar
And what if the king already knew that she had broken the law. ,Seminar
It would be just a thing that this King would do I think.,Seminar
But I do also think that it is possible that the King could be in on it too. ,Seminar
He could know that she knows which door is which and he seems like the type of king to enjoy that punishment,Seminar
but I think we should incorporate the King mentioning that he helped feed his daughter the information on what was behind each door. ,Seminar
"I think that when the King discovers his daughter broke the law, he would still make her go through the arena.",Seminar
This could either cause the King to become even more barbaric or to stop these trials all together,Seminar
and it would depend what they feel the princess cares about more - his life or him being married to another woman.,Seminar
that he sentences the princess to the same trial that he is on. ,Seminar
"but at the same time, as you stated, the princess is herself in a greater trial than the man in that she has to decide whether to kill or not kill her lover who has hurt so deeply.",Seminar
"I feel that it would be fitting for the king to sentence her to the same trial, because they king and princess are both constantly described as semi-barbaric"" throughout the text.",Seminar
"There seems to be very little compassion or empathy displayed by the king or the princess  even when the princess thinks of her lover  she thinks of herself not necessarily him.""",Seminar
I honestly donâ€™t think the king would have done anything after discovering his daughter broke the law. He probably covered it up or considered her already punished through her lovers fate.,Seminar
The King does seem unstable enough to put his daughter on trial via the lady and the tiger method. I imagine she'd use her own connections to find out which door had the tiger behind it and which door had a suitor.,Seminar
"Louise Campbell, I agree with you in thinking that the king covered it up somehow and didn't put her through the trial.",Seminar
Should we go with the choices that have a majority? So the lady behind the door and the king covering up for his daughter?,Deliberation
"I think the King would offer her the same choice between the two doors, he seems to really like this punishment.",Seminar
"I think it would depend on how much she truly trust her lover. If she had faith in him truly, she would let him live with the lady. At least he would be alive and happy. But if she was full of distrust or jealousy she would kill her lover. Even if she is semi-barbaric she seems to be fair or at least a follower of her Father. I would say she would point to the Lady in the end.",Seminar
"Upon discovering his daughter has broken the law, the King responds out of love, because she is the apple of his eye, and he forgives her.",Seminar
I agree that the princess could just banish the new couple away too. Do we have to agree on a single ending?,"Seminar, Deliberation"
"So the King would come back at the boyfriend later due to him ""cheating"" the trial? I can see that.",Seminar
As for the second question I believe that the king would try to cover up the fact she broke the law. I only say that because if he was that mad because someone was her lover I doubt he would send her to die. He would probably rather punish her in private.,Seminar
"As for the second part, I'm not sure if the King would carry out the same punishment for his daughter as he would the commoners. However, he would definitely think of another way to punish her that would consist of a clever, yet barbaric twist for her to prove her loyalty and worth.",Seminar
I  think she sends him to the door with the tiger. When the king finds out that she knew he is so pleased by her barbarism that he does nothing but inside he has now decided that she is a worthy predecessor.,Seminar
I believe the King would be upset that the rules of his arena were broken. But,Seminar
"But I think he would also revel in the fact that his daughter could be so barbaric. However, he does seem to hold the random chance of fate of the arena in the highest regard so although he loves his daughter above all else I think he may make an example of her. Especially if the people found out what happened",Seminar
"Just realized I never answered the second question. I also agree that while the king may feel a bit of pride for his daughter, he holds his beliefs in his chance of fate style of justice so closely to his chest, so he most likely made an example out of his daughter as well.",Seminar
Hey Ashley Peterson! I also wanted to mention the story mention the King's barbaric nature numerous times so it is highly likely that he would punish his daughter.,Seminar
"Oh definitely! I wrote out a possible response beneath your reiteration. Feel free to add/delete whichever parts! Joyce Brown, do you have any further thoughts about how the king would react? You mentioned he would most likely decide his daughter would be a worthy predecessor while Denise Harris and I believe he would punish her anyway.",Seminar
"So if the King puts his daughter on trial, does that mean he sets her up with 2 doors as well?",Seminar
"I think it's barbaric nature but also slightly just (in a warped way), because as it mentions he treated women and men equally so would feel obliged to treat his daughter the same",Seminar
I mean I think it states that the king does love the daughter at some point though.,Seminar
"Maybe write that the king, despite his love for his daughter, could only act in a barbaric manner",Seminar
yet also leaves it open ended (because how can we decide whether the princess lives or dies),Seminar
"As for part 2 of the question...I think the father upon finding out what the daughter had done would totally subvert the natural order of things and not have her go through the process of justice that others do. He would be furious with her and would punish her in some way but, not by putting her in the arena. I dont think he could cope with her dying by the tiger or being forced to marry a person below her royal status.",Seminar
"despite the consistent behavior and system of punishment, I do not think the king would send his daughter to the arena. The story tells us that she is the apple of his eye  and that she is above all what his heart cares for.  I do not think he could bear losing her or watching her give love to anyone but him.  I fear the father would punish her by keeping her with him for the rest of her life.  Going to the arena would be too much punishment for him.",Seminar
I believe she sent him to the tiger.  A king's daughter would not want to share a lover or see him with another woman.,Seminar
Part 2:  I don't think the King will do anything to the Princess.  He knows both choices would be punishment for her and her lover.,Seminar
"Part 1: If she loves him, the princess will lead her lover to the door that will allow him to live. If she allows greed and envy to cloud her judgement, she will likely lead her lover to his death.",Seminar
"Part 2: If the King is unbiased, he will treat her like any other person who had broken the law.",Seminar
"I found myself conflicted for the princess. I always want a happy ending of some kind in the stories I read. However, it seems the princess loses either way in this story. If I were in her place, I would have allowed him to marry the woman rather than have him die a painful and bloody death.",Imaginative entry
"As for the King, he will likely send his daughter to face the same punishment as her lover. As a King, he should treat all lawbreaking the same. However, I wonder if he will crack and pull the same trick that the princess had with her lover or if he will remain firm with his decision.",Seminar
"It depends upon where the author wants to take the story. Given the princess's stealth and cunning in find out what was behind each door, I think she would rather see her lover dead than alive.",Seminar
"Hi Anne Lee. Yes, the reader will certainly bring her or his background and ideas to the story. And the king did indeed get what he wanted. Good points!",Seminar
"As for the second question, I imagine the king would definitely send the princess to her own trial just like her lover. His barbarism is so calculated. He has come up with his perfect judgement system, allowing the accused to choose their own fate and leave it up to chance. I don't think there would be any exception to his system, even his own daughter.",Seminar
"As for the 2nd part of the discussion, I don't think the king will ever hurt his daughter as it was mentioned in the story that she is the apple of his eye. I could see him scolding at the princess and put restrictions on her as punishment. In the story, it was implied that the princess is cunning and intelligent so I would suspect she can use her intelligence to calm down her father by appealing to his emotional side since the king is the barbaric one.  I could also see the princess twisting her father's logic that it is fate/chance that the princess has to break the law because if it  was really chance that determines all actions, then chance would had not let the princess not break the law (I hope that makes sense).",Seminar
*would not let the princess break the law in the first place.,Seminar
"As for the King, I believe his system works and would put her through the same system because he fully believes in it. Not sure he wouldn't make sure what door the lion would be in and send her to the man of his choice. He is semibarbaric but loves his daughter and what better justice than marrying her with someone of his choice. Interesting ideas everyone...good job. :)",Seminar
"When the King discovers that his daughter has broken the law, I believe he would most likely make an exception for her. In the story it stated that the King put the love for his  therefore I highly doubt he would send her into the arena. Because of the King views himself and his daughter as royalty, I would speculate that he would come up with an  alternate punishment for his daughter . daughter above all of humanity"" and that she was the ""apple of his eye",Seminar
"I think that she sends her lover to another woman. Even though the thought of him being with someone else is devastating, I don't think she could handle knowing that she  I was secretly hoping that the Princess would find a way to be the woman behind the door that I can't see her just setting him up to die! I think that the King would put his daughter through the system caused his death. I agree with the idea that we will all bring our own ideas to how we interpret the story; I have always been a Disney fantasyland"" sort of girl- true love conquers all and all that other stuff. But she took such a risk to love him  even if that meant changing his rules about who could court his daughter. As I was reading the story  defying her father and choosing true love over being a princess!""",Seminar
"Ana, I agree with you that the king is so adamant that his system is perfect that he would subject his daughter to it. I think he is somewhat blinded by his own importance, and feels that as king he should also be in charge of everyone's fate.  because if he truly loved her he would not have sent the one man that she loved into the arena. He would have moved mountains to make her happy",Seminar
"Part Two:  I believe the King would send his daughter to the tribunal, because even though he loves her and she is the apple of his eye, he is illustrated to be set in his ways.  He would not make an exception for her because he feels that he needs to establish his power over the citizens of the kingdom.  If he subjects his daughter to the same punishment, then he is proving his stance and making an example of her to his kingdom.  I believe she would find a way to outwit the King, maybe with the help of her lover who she granted life to in part one.",Seminar
"Although the King is one that like to follows the rules and has a very barbaric side, he doesn't send his daughter to the tribunal. Instead he makes her live with the agony of living without her love and while facing the fact of her character.",Seminar
"Part Two: I think if the King discovered the truth and that the Princess had broken the law, she would be sent to the same fate as her lover. Having to choose between the two  he would ultimately make her choose which door just like other so-called criminals."" doors. The King thinks himself fair and seems to care a great deal about maintaining his just"" rule and appearance. I do think that even if he loves his daughter",Seminar
"Part 2: I believe that the king will not make an example of his daughter for the kingdom, as this would display a bad reputation for the royal family. Instead, I believe the king will keep the knowledge of his daughter's crime to himself with the knowledge that he sent her love on a different path and she can no longer have him.",Seminar
"Hello Helen Howard, I agree with your thoughts on the decision for part 1, but I don't believe the king would amplify the mistakes of his daughter by sending her to the tribunal as it would make the royal family look bad in the eyes of the public if everyone knew of her crimes.",Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I feel this text is meant to unsettle in a way. It wasn't just the barbarism but also the mention of ancestry and blood that made me think it was fatalistic in a way. Kind of like the King and Princess were destined to act in cruel ways. I'm glad that someone else picked up on it too and I really liked your point that it does feel labeling a society in sweeping terms.,Seminar
"Part 2:  I believe that the King made his daughter face her fate in the King's arena.  The King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena.  The King didn't care whether or not his daughter would be traumatized by the event.  By sending his daughter's lover to the arena, he proved that he cared more about his own rules than the happiness and well-being of his family.  The King was more barbaric than civilized and he was very set in his ways.",Seminar
"Hello Sandra Coleman, I think it's a good point you made that the King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena. It does seem that when he caught them, it was immediately understood that the lover would have to put his life on the line. For that reason and his barbaric nature that is quoted a lot, I also believe he would make his daughter face her fate in the King's arena.",Seminar
"Part 2: With how the King wants to assert his power over his kingdom and people, I believe he would make an example out of his daughter and send her to same fate as her lover. He didn't take her feelings about her lover into consideration so that shows how brutal his mind and rule is.",Seminar
Part 1: I think the princess hints to him the door with the lover. She is described as only semi barberous and so by having her show mercy to her former lover she provides a foil of free will to the Barbarous Kings fate based judicious system.,Seminar
Part 2:I think the king has to send his daughter to the ring. She has broken the rules like anyone else and so as someone who has put their trust in fate he would subject his daughter to the same punishment. Ultimately I think he would believe that she would prevail in hist justice system.,Seminar
"Part 2: With the events led, created, and executed by the king, one would believe he would send his daughter to the arena as she has committed a crime, embarrassed the king, and went against the rules. He is semi-barbaric so he will probably feel guilt as the story states he loves his daughter, but he is also king. He wants to keep in power and with these events, shows his power to rule over life and death. His character would choose fame, power, and glory over love as with these events, sympathy is not a strong theme in this story.",Seminar
"Hi Douglas Jackson, I like your point in Part 1 about semi barbarous but I feel she showed her mercy in dwelling on the issues day and night, losing sleep, and imagining both scenarios. The readers feels the guilt she portrays, but in the end I believe with her being the daughter of the king who created this judicial system, and growing up around these barbarous events, she sent him into the lions den - literally!",Seminar
In part one I think he chose the princess because of her hints.  In part two she broke the rules so the king must be true to his role as leader and must trust fate and deal with his daughter how he would anyone else.,Seminar
"Hello Emily James I agree with your rational regarding part 2. The king would lose respect and his reputation if he did not deal with her in the same way as others. I agree he will feel guilty and I'm sure it was difficult, but again he needs to save face.",Seminar
"Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?",Seminar
I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.,Seminar
Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(,Seminar
"If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.",Seminar
That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well,Seminar
"Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?",Imaginative entry
"Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?",Seminar
"Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.",Seminar
So I'm not sure if the king would've had a hand in putting her lover behind the door.,Seminar
"But it would be interesting if the princess's actions in breaking the law made her father realize just how much she loved the man (if she did tell him of the door with the lady). So maybe he could've used his influence to put her lover behind the door, that way he could still abide by his own law but also extend love to his daughter.",Seminar
