of the author's word choice of barbarism.,Seminar
"given the two terrible choices,",Seminar
imagine this to be the catalyst that ends his idea of public punishment. ,Seminar
I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an ,Seminar
I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an opportunity for the king to re-examine the practice.,Seminar
"The more I think about this activity, the more I wonder if we are supposed to be collaboratively writing an end to the story. ",Deliberation
What were your thoughts?,Deliberation
" I have to say, the line of thinking is still technically flawed.",Seminar
What would happen then?,Seminar
What do you guys think? ,Seminar
I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.,Imaginative entry
I couldn't either.,Procedure
So how do you guys think we should end it?,Deliberation
I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.,Seminar
"How do you think it should end, Emilie?",Seminar
And I almost think if we can't decide we might just flip a coin ,Seminar
I think we just leave it here? I'm not totally sure,UX
"Part 1: Ultimately, it is left for the reader to decide what is behind the door,",Seminar
Part 1: It is such an agonizing question of whether the lady or the tiger is behind the door. ,Seminar
"The text describes the anxiety of being in a huge stadium with a roaring crowd and the fear of being killed horribly by a tiger, ",Seminar
I hadn't thought of when I read the piece,Seminar
"Yeah, I was going back and forth a lot on what I think happened. So I can definitely see your reasoning for her picking the lady.",Seminar
"So, where have we landed: Lady or tiger? Trial or coverup? I think we just have to write something in the space below.","Seminar, Deliberation"
"Is the response we write in the field below supposed to be in the same style of the story, like we're completing it? Or are we just answering the questions?",Deliberation
The Lady was behind the door.,Seminar
Do we answer these before continuing the story?,Deliberation
"Ok, I had to reset the book to make this work!",Deliberation
"Live without was the first one I put.  Then Trust, Love, and then Know",Deliberation
she was smiling by the end and the book told me i did well,Deliberation
The second question here is just as complex for different reasons,Seminar
me too. It said wrong!,Deliberation
there is a wrong answer?  thats weird,Deliberation
It is wrong because they want the character to respond to each question one at a time.,UX
Should we write it as continuing the story or just as a normal response?,Deliberation
Did you guys get the final question,Deliberation
I'm not sure what you mean by the final question. Once I put in the 4 questions it let me finish reading the last two pages.,UX
and then it just seems to end,UX
I just added a title submitted so I guess we're done. This was very interesting and challenging.,Deliberation
"Hi Diane Gonzalez and Deborah Evans. I'm sorry to be so late joining the conversation. If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice",Seminar
"Curiosity got the best of me, and I googled this book, which I'd never heard of despite it being a well-known allegory. It presents an unsolvable problem, yet we all felt pretty confident taking a stab at answering the prompts. I wonder what we are to make of all of us feeling pretty certain the princess chose the tiger. Is our choice based on the author's characterization of her or our belief that human nature is fundamentally selfish?",Seminar
I don't think I should have gone outside this platform to Google the book since this is supposed to be a discussion between us via this platform. Sorry about that.,Deliberation
"Cheryl Diaz, you bring up a good point - are we truly using the information gained through the reading or our own beliefs that human nature is fundamentally selfish. You really have me thinking about this.",Seminar
"Dr. Austin said have fun with it, and it is fun to ponder what might happen in the story. I think the main reason for setting a time to discuss it at the same time would be to test the collaborative software, using the box below instead of this one. I believe we could all write in it at the same time and see each other typing and change each other's words until we all agree we are done with our assessment. If we are able to do that, we might find there are unexpected positives or negatives to the collaboration process or system that we can only otherwise surmise. As you say, we've all responded to the prompts, so what we say doesn't matter that much, so all we'd need is a few minutes to see how using the box works. So if you want to try meeting, I could do Wednesday any time of day. Just set a time and I'll log on then. Thanks.",Procedure
"Hi. I'm not sure if we were supposed to ultimately write an ending to the story or just answer the prompts collectively. I wrote an ending below, and you can change it or replace it. We just want to test the use of the space at the same time, I think.",Procedure
"Ha, I meant successor.",Seminar
Hi everyone! I have read the story and am ready to discuss.  I can log back in later to see if anyone else is ready.  Should we try to figure out a time to all come back and work in here together?,Procedure
"I read the story and I am ready for discussion too. Let's decide on a mutual time for this. Thanks,",Procedure
"Ok, that's how I understand it as well. Let's wait a few more minutes to give Julie a chance to join us. Sound good?",Procedure
"Yes. and honestly, the first time I read the prompt I thought we were just answering the questions in a method of critical thinking question. Now I am wondering if we are supposed to write an ending",Procedure
It really could be interpreted either way. Just answer questions or write an ending . . . .,Deliberation
"Yes, potentially something for the research team to work on clarifying....",Deliberation
"Ok, we all thought the tiger!",Seminar
does this mean we are barbaric too?,Imaginative
Are we all supposed to write our answers below?,Deliberation
"Yes, I think so. We were discussing if we write it like answers or finish the story? Thoughts?",Deliberation
I'm not sure about the ending if we pick the door for her...personally as a (casual) author I would not want to pick an ending in this case,Deliberation
...then the same for the second part?,Deliberation
is that too much?,Seminar
Is the second sentence for part 2 okay?,Seminar
He was tied to his own idealistic principles?,Seminar
"There, lol. what do you girls think?",Seminar
"So, we title it SUBMITTED and that's it, right?",Deliberation
"Yes, and I know that we are going with just answering but should you want to see an ending I was messing around with I would gladly share (we don't have to submit that necessarily)",Deliberation
We could leave it in if you want. We've answered the questions and then some. I don't think it would hurt. What do you girls think?,Deliberation
"If you would like, we can leave both our answers and your ending. That way we have both options covered. But if you'd rather not that's okay too.",Deliberation
"I agree, Linda Long. If you are okay with that, Michelle Rivera?",Deliberation
"I feel the flow doesn't entirely match the original story, but I felt it was awkwardly written and okay. We can add (ending) before it?",Deliberation
I say leave it in. It's well-written and adds depth to the answers.,Deliberation
Good idea. And I agree that original story was very awkwardly written. The syntax was strange.,Seminar
"It might not add to the style in which it was written, but what you predicted to happen fits well with the story in my opinion",Seminar
I agree Linda Long. It makes logical sense as a conclusion based on previous events in the story.,Seminar
"Well, the title of the story is a question - one that may never be answered. I think that was deliberate.",Seminar
"I enjoyed reading all of your perspectives.  Nicole Gonzalez- I also found the idea of barbarism"" kind of unsettling... I guess it was a pretty common theme in story telling in the ""old  but reading from my 21st century perspective days""  it feels like labeling the society as ""other"" or ""bad"".""",Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I feel this text is meant to unsettle in a way. It wasn't just the barbarism but also the mention of ancestry and blood that made me think it was fatalistic in a way. Kind of like the King and Princess were destined to act in cruel ways. I'm glad that someone else picked up on it too and I really liked your point that it does feel labeling a society in sweeping terms.,Seminar
I have never heard this story before... and I was wondering if it is some kind of folk tale?  Has anyone else seen this story before and do you know what culture it is from?,Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I actually had the same question as I had never heard this story before. So I did some research! This short story was written by Frank Stockton in 1882. Stockton wrote a follow up to this story called The Discourager of Hesitancy. He seems to like open-ended stories like these.,Seminar
"Thanks for the info and research, I was wondering about this story as well. I've never read it before.",Seminar
"Okay, cool! Should we wait a couple of minutes for Rebecca or get started?",Social
I don't think this e-book times out so we should be ok,UX
"it says Alexandrea, Matthew and Sara looked at this 18 days ago. How is this possible? I thought the activity just opened up this week?",UX
So did I. Do you think they are in another course?,UX
"So regarding part 1 of the question, I think the lady is behind the door!",Seminar
That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending,Seminar
Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.,UX
"What about you, Rebecca?",Seminar
"Oh, sorry! Yes I read it",Seminar
"Rebecca, it was a bit glitchy with me at times and I refreshed and logged back in",UX
I tried to read it before 7 but it's stuck on that one part,UX
"Okay, I agree, I think the lady is behind the door.",Seminar
"Well said, Rebecca",Seminar
That was in response to Rebecca's question.,Seminar
"Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?",Seminar
I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?,Seminar
Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.,Seminar
"Natalie, are you still there?",Social
I guess that was all we had to do? I don't know if there's anything else to discuss,Procedure
I also found the story confusing and I had to re-read it several times,Seminar
I guess the ending depends on how everyone interprets it,Seminar
I'm so sorry to have missed this initial conversation. I was dealing with some personal matters that prevented me from doing so. But I've caught up and I greatly enjoyed reading the discourse here.,Social
I had similar issues reading the writing style. It took a few times to really get to the core of what was being said.,Seminar
