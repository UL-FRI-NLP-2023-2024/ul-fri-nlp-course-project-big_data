of the author's word choice of barbarism.,Seminar
"The more I think about this activity, the more I wonder if we are supposed to be collaboratively writing an end to the story. ",Deliberation
Perhaps the top of this page (where we type and send messages) is for planning and the bottom (open white area) is for writing an end to the story? ,UX
"I could write the first draft based on my interpretation of our answers, then we could take turns editing - round robin style until we are happy with the result",Deliberation
What were your thoughts?,Deliberation
because while I agree with the first part said,Seminar
" I have to say, the line of thinking is still technically flawed.",Seminar
So how do you guys think we should end it?,Deliberation
"I'm honestly okay with either ending, ",Deliberation
I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.,Seminar
"How do you think it should end, Emilie?",Seminar
I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. ,Seminar
"As for Part 2, I have a theory. ",Seminar
 I'm definitely okay with another approach that we can all agree on,Seminar
That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.,Seminar
(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing),Social
Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.,Deliberation
I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. ,Deliberation
That's some amazing writing! ,Social
"Part 1: Ultimately, it is left for the reader to decide what is behind the door,",Seminar
I hadn't thought of when I read the piece,Seminar
"Is the response we write in the field below supposed to be in the same style of the story, like we're completing it? Or are we just answering the questions?",Deliberation
I'm good with writing the majority choices.,Deliberation
The four questions,Deliberation
Do we answer these before continuing the story?,Deliberation
she was smiling by the end and the book told me i did well,Deliberation
The second question here is just as complex for different reasons,Seminar
It is wrong because they want the character to respond to each question one at a time.,UX
Should we write it as continuing the story or just as a normal response?,Deliberation
we should keep it simple,Deliberation
I'm not sure what you mean by the final question. Once I put in the 4 questions it let me finish reading the last two pages.,UX
and then it just seems to end,UX
I don't think I should have gone outside this platform to Google the book since this is supposed to be a discussion between us via this platform. Sorry about that.,Deliberation
"Cheryl Diaz, you bring up a good point - are we truly using the information gained through the reading or our own beliefs that human nature is fundamentally selfish. You really have me thinking about this.",Seminar
"Hi. I'm not sure if we were supposed to ultimately write an ending to the story or just answer the prompts collectively. I wrote an ending below, and you can change it or replace it. We just want to test the use of the space at the same time, I think.",Procedure
"I added a brief ending. If everyone is good with it, lets hit submit",Deliberation
"I read the story and I am ready for discussion too. Let's decide on a mutual time for this. Thanks,",Procedure
"Yes. and honestly, the first time I read the prompt I thought we were just answering the questions in a method of critical thinking question. Now I am wondering if we are supposed to write an ending",Procedure
Good point. I thought the same thing about how to answer the questions.,Procedure
It really could be interpreted either way. Just answer questions or write an ending . . . .,Deliberation
"Yes, potentially something for the research team to work on clarifying....",Deliberation
"So, what do you think about the questions?",Deliberation
does this mean we are barbaric too?,Imaginative
Are we all supposed to write our answers below?,Deliberation
"Yes, I think so. We were discussing if we write it like answers or finish the story? Thoughts?",Deliberation
"Good question Julie, we were discussing before you logged on, we are not quite sure if the prompt is looking for just the answers or an ending to be written",Deliberation
I think we are supposed to surmise or predict what we think happens,Deliberation
Okay so maybe we could each write out an answer for the first part of the question and then we edit the response into one?,Deliberation
...then the same for the second part?,Deliberation
"Yes, I'd rather keep it simple lol",Deliberation
Is the second sentence for part 2 okay?,Seminar
I like it. It draws from the story.,Seminar
"Yes, and I know that we are going with just answering but should you want to see an ending I was messing around with I would gladly share (we don't have to submit that necessarily)",Deliberation
Yes it fits well with the story,Deliberation
We could leave it in if you want. We've answered the questions and then some. I don't think it would hurt. What do you girls think?,Deliberation
"If you would like, we can leave both our answers and your ending. That way we have both options covered. But if you'd rather not that's okay too.",Deliberation
"I feel the flow doesn't entirely match the original story, but I felt it was awkwardly written and okay. We can add (ending) before it?",Deliberation
I say leave it in. It's well-written and adds depth to the answers.,Deliberation
Good with the parentheses?,Deliberation
Good idea. And I agree that original story was very awkwardly written. The syntax was strange.,Seminar
"It might not add to the style in which it was written, but what you predicted to happen fits well with the story in my opinion",Seminar
I agree Linda Long. It makes logical sense as a conclusion based on previous events in the story.,Seminar
"Well, the title of the story is a question - one that may never be answered. I think that was deliberate.",Seminar
"I agree with Anne Marie and Rachel, ",Seminar
"I enjoyed reading all of your perspectives.  Nicole Gonzalez- I also found the idea of barbarism"" kind of unsettling... I guess it was a pretty common theme in story telling in the ""old  but reading from my 21st century perspective days""  it feels like labeling the society as ""other"" or ""bad"".""",Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I feel this text is meant to unsettle in a way. It wasn't just the barbarism but also the mention of ancestry and blood that made me think it was fatalistic in a way. Kind of like the King and Princess were destined to act in cruel ways. I'm glad that someone else picked up on it too and I really liked your point that it does feel labeling a society in sweeping terms.,Seminar
I have never heard this story before... and I was wondering if it is some kind of folk tale?  Has anyone else seen this story before and do you know what culture it is from?,Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I actually had the same question as I had never heard this story before. So I did some research! This short story was written by Frank Stockton in 1882. Stockton wrote a follow up to this story called The Discourager of Hesitancy. He seems to like open-ended stories like these.,Seminar
"Thanks for the info and research, I was wondering about this story as well. I've never read it before.",Seminar
I don't think this e-book times out so we should be ok,UX
That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending,Seminar
Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.,UX
"Oh, sorry! Yes I read it",Seminar
I tried to read it before 7 but it's stuck on that one part,UX
"Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy",Seminar
I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?,Seminar
Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.,Seminar
I guess that was all we had to do? I don't know if there's anything else to discuss,Procedure
I also found the story confusing and I had to re-read it several times,Seminar
I guess the ending depends on how everyone interprets it,Seminar
I'm so sorry to have missed this initial conversation. I was dealing with some personal matters that prevented me from doing so. But I've caught up and I greatly enjoyed reading the discourse here.,Social
I had similar issues reading the writing style. It took a few times to really get to the core of what was being said.,Seminar
