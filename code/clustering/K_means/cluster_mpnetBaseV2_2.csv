of the author's word choice of barbarism.,Seminar
"The more I think about this activity, the more I wonder if we are supposed to be collaboratively writing an end to the story. ",Deliberation
Perhaps the top of this page (where we type and send messages) is for planning and the bottom (open white area) is for writing an end to the story? ,UX
I'm overall a little confused by this entire module ,Deliberation
"I could write the first draft based on my interpretation of our answers, then we could take turns editing - round robin style until we are happy with the result",Deliberation
We can try to get in touch with them and decide how we wat to write out the answer,Procedure
I couldn't either.,Procedure
I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. ,Seminar
"As for Part 2, I have a theory. ",Seminar
(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing),Social
Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.,Deliberation
I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. ,Deliberation
"Kyra, I LOVE what you did for part 1!! ",Social
That's some amazing writing! ,Social
Let's hope I do as well on part 2!!,Social
Any idea on how to submit it?,UX
I think we just leave it here? I'm not totally sure,UX
Yeah I was wondering because when I click 'My Answer' at the top it says I haven't submitted one. ,UX
Or when the survey comes out maybe something will be there,UX
I hadn't thought of when I read the piece,Seminar
"Is the response we write in the field below supposed to be in the same style of the story, like we're completing it? Or are we just answering the questions?",Deliberation
I'm good with writing the majority choices.,Deliberation
"Unfortunately I can't click in the box below at all, so it's anyone's guess what style our response is supposed to be in. I would imagine answering the questions simply would be fine.",UX
Looks good. I think to mark our assignment done we just have to write SUBMITTED at the top of the entry.,UX
Wait how do we submit this assignment?,Deliberation
The four questions,Deliberation
Do we answer these before continuing the story?,Deliberation
"So the top is for chatting and the bottom is for responding, I believe.",Deliberation
"Ok, I had to reset the book to make this work!",Deliberation
"Yep, so what you think the questions are?",Deliberation
she was smiling by the end and the book told me i did well,Deliberation
Which questions? like the prompt?,Deliberation
But it asked for 4 so i amswered with 4,Deliberation
"At the top of the screen are two questions, I believe that is what the 1 & 2 are on the bottom portion",Deliberation
I tried the ones you mentioned it said try again.,Deliberation
You have to do them one at a time,Deliberation
I tried them all at once and it told me wrong lol,Deliberation
The second question here is just as complex for different reasons,Seminar
me too. It said wrong!,Deliberation
there is a wrong answer?  thats weird,Deliberation
It is wrong because they want the character to respond to each question one at a time.,UX
Should we write it as continuing the story or just as a normal response?,Deliberation
Hey guys I got through the next page,Deliberation
Did you guys get the final question,Deliberation
I'm not sure what you mean by the final question. Once I put in the 4 questions it let me finish reading the last two pages.,UX
"Does anyone have any idea how to ""add the title SUBMITTED"" to our response?",UX
I just added a title submitted so I guess we're done. This was very interesting and challenging.,Deliberation
Don't forget we have to go on to canvas and complete the survey and submit it,Deliberation
I don't think I should have gone outside this platform to Google the book since this is supposed to be a discussion between us via this platform. Sorry about that.,Deliberation
"Cheryl Diaz, you bring up a good point - are we truly using the information gained through the reading or our own beliefs that human nature is fundamentally selfish. You really have me thinking about this.",Seminar
"Hi. I'm not sure if we were supposed to ultimately write an ending to the story or just answer the prompts collectively. I wrote an ending below, and you can change it or replace it. We just want to test the use of the space at the same time, I think.",Procedure
Do you see what I typed in the box below?,Procedure
I did this assignment twice last semester. I think they are just trying to get feedback on how it works/doesn't work. If the prompts and/or grouping is sufficient.,Procedure
Looks good! I guess we can complete the post survey and submit our assignment,"Social, Procedure"
"I added a brief ending. If everyone is good with it, lets hit submit",Deliberation
"So, we discuss the prompt here and then write it together in the box below?",Procedure
"Yes. and honestly, the first time I read the prompt I thought we were just answering the questions in a method of critical thinking question. Now I am wondering if we are supposed to write an ending",Procedure
Good point. I thought the same thing about how to answer the questions.,Procedure
It really could be interpreted either way. Just answer questions or write an ending . . . .,Deliberation
"Yes, potentially something for the research team to work on clarifying....",Deliberation
"So, what do you think about the questions?",Deliberation
Are we all supposed to write our answers below?,Deliberation
"Yes, I think so. We were discussing if we write it like answers or finish the story? Thoughts?",Deliberation
"Good question Julie, we were discussing before you logged on, we are not quite sure if the prompt is looking for just the answers or an ending to be written",Deliberation
I think we are supposed to surmise or predict what we think happens,Deliberation
Okay so maybe we could each write out an answer for the first part of the question and then we edit the response into one?,Deliberation
...then the same for the second part?,Deliberation
Is the second sentence for part 2 okay?,Seminar
I like it. It draws from the story.,Seminar
"So, we title it SUBMITTED and that's it, right?",Deliberation
"Yes, I believe so and then fill out the survey thing back on canvas saying we completed the assignment. And that's it right?",Deliberation
"Yes, and I know that we are going with just answering but should you want to see an ending I was messing around with I would gladly share (we don't have to submit that necessarily)",Deliberation
I believe that is all the survey and canvas yes,Procedure
Yes it fits well with the story,Deliberation
We could leave it in if you want. We've answered the questions and then some. I don't think it would hurt. What do you girls think?,Deliberation
"If you would like, we can leave both our answers and your ending. That way we have both options covered. But if you'd rather not that's okay too.",Deliberation
"I feel the flow doesn't entirely match the original story, but I felt it was awkwardly written and okay. We can add (ending) before it?",Deliberation
I say leave it in. It's well-written and adds depth to the answers.,Deliberation
Good with the parentheses?,Deliberation
Good idea. And I agree that original story was very awkwardly written. The syntax was strange.,Seminar
"It might not add to the style in which it was written, but what you predicted to happen fits well with the story in my opinion",Seminar
"Well, the title of the story is a question - one that may never be answered. I think that was deliberate.",Seminar
"I enjoyed reading all of your perspectives.  Nicole Gonzalez- I also found the idea of barbarism"" kind of unsettling... I guess it was a pretty common theme in story telling in the ""old  but reading from my 21st century perspective days""  it feels like labeling the society as ""other"" or ""bad"".""",Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I actually had the same question as I had never heard this story before. So I did some research! This short story was written by Frank Stockton in 1882. Stockton wrote a follow up to this story called The Discourager of Hesitancy. He seems to like open-ended stories like these.,Seminar
"Thanks for the info and research, I was wondering about this story as well. I've never read it before.",Seminar
"it says Alexandrea, Matthew and Sara looked at this 18 days ago. How is this possible? I thought the activity just opened up this week?",UX
Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.,UX
"Oh, sorry! Yes I read it",Seminar
"Oh yeah Rebecca, in order to get past page 8, you have to form 5 questions with the tiles on bottom of screen",UX
then click submit,UX
I tried to read it before 7 but it's stuck on that one part,UX
then click on the checkmark button,UX
I had to ask my spouse for help,Social
"Oh, yeah! You make up the questions and then can advance!",UX
"Each time you submit, the lady talks back to you and her icon changes.",UX
Which browser did you use?,UX
It took me 10 tried. Then I got it,UX
It doesn't matter the combo of the questions,UX
I'm in google chrome,UX
"Yes, it has to be chrome or firefox",UX
That was in response to Rebecca's question.,Seminar
"Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?",Seminar
I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?,Seminar
Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.,Seminar
I also found the story confusing and I had to re-read it several times,Seminar
I had similar issues reading the writing style. It took a few times to really get to the core of what was being said.,Seminar
