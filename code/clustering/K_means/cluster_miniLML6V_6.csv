" Sadly  the barbaric nature of the king and princess is still alive today in crimes of passion.""",Seminar
"If the princess possesses the same semi-barbaric trait as her father, then it would seem she directed her lover to the door with the tiger. ",Seminar
 It could be argued that the informant is more guilty than the princess and is sent to show the kingdom the consequence of such behaviors.,Seminar
 that the Princess's barbaric traits will lead the princess to send her lover to his death.,Seminar
"She exhibits immaturity and cruelty by fixating on imagined flirtations between ""the lady"" and the princess's lover.",Seminar
and Meg brought and interesting topic of the difference between how the princess rambles on about him opening the door with the lady but barely mentions him opening the door with the tiger.,Seminar
The princess has no qualms about her lover dying but,Seminar
"Part 1: For this question, our team decided that the princess chose the door with the tiger. ",Seminar
" In the story  it is mentioned several times that the princess is jealous of the idea of her lover being with another woman  stating ""her soul had burned in agony when he rushed to meet that woman"" (pp. 10).",Seminar
But I'm not sure how this princess would think.,Seminar
My initial thoughts were that the princess knows what's behind each of the doors because the King had told her or she figured it out from overhearing him talk about the punishment.,Seminar
"Oooo I have another idea! What if the princess sends the man to the tiger and right out tells her father she did it and wants a trial. Then because he loves her he begs her to choose the door with the young man he picks for her, but she chooses the tiger.",Seminar
and it would depend what they feel the princess cares about more - his life or him being married to another woman.,Seminar
Part 1: It is such an agonizing question of whether the lady or the tiger is behind the door. ,Seminar
"that the lady is behind the door; that the princess might be able to also feel that to take another human life, even when that life has so greatly wronged you, is far worse than to ",Seminar
that he sentences the princess to the same trial that he is on. ,Seminar
"but at the same time, as you stated, the princess is herself in a greater trial than the man in that she has to decide whether to kill or not kill her lover who has hurt so deeply.",Seminar
"There seems to be very little compassion or empathy displayed by the king or the princess  even when the princess thinks of her lover  she thinks of herself not necessarily him.""",Seminar
"I think the tiger was behind the door. Mostly because of the princess being described as ""hot-blooded and semi-barbaric.""",Seminar
"I want to believe the tiger was behind the door because the princess was semi-barbaric but she was also filled with despair and jealousy.  The green eyed monster.. gets you every time...so she knows she has lost him, but she doesn't have to let the Lady have him.",Seminar
"I believe the lady was behind the door as the description of the princess was ""semi-barbaric."" She could probably have the new couple banished from the kingdom so she would not have to see them. I believe it was the tiger because the princess could not bear for anyone else to have him.",Seminar
I agree that the princess could just banish the new couple away too. Do we have to agree on a single ending?,"Seminar, Deliberation"
"Oh I see, there are two questions here.  I feel that the princess would have led him to the tiger","Deliberation, Seminar"
"I agree with you, Diane Gonzalez. I am convinced that the princess lead the gentleman to the door hiding the tiger. It would make a brilliant plot twist, but with the information we know about the character of the King, that can be found within the princess as well. In my mind she believes if she can't have the man, she sure does not want another woman to have him, especially someone she despises.",Seminar
"Hi Diane Gonzalez and Deborah Evans. I'm sorry to be so late joining the conversation. If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice",Seminar
"Curiosity got the best of me, and I googled this book, which I'd never heard of despite it being a well-known allegory. It presents an unsolvable problem, yet we all felt pretty confident taking a stab at answering the prompts. I wonder what we are to make of all of us feeling pretty certain the princess chose the tiger. Is our choice based on the author's characterization of her or our belief that human nature is fundamentally selfish?",Seminar
yet also leaves it open ended (because how can we decide whether the princess lives or dies),Seminar
"Part 1
I believe that the lady will be behind the doors. I think that the Princess loved her lover too much to allow him to be eaten by the Tiger. She would rather see him out and about the kingdom happy with someone else then torn into pieces by the tiger.  However, I am a divorced mom of two kids and my interpretation might be a little off, since I always wanted and are still looking for that fairy tale kind of ending. The one where true love exists no matter what the couple faces.

Part 2
I believe that",Seminar
"Part 2
I believe that when the King discovers that his daughter had broken the law by finding out what was behind the door and then signaling to her lover which one to open, he would be in infuriated. The story stated that he was extremely close to the Princess and resented her se ret relationship.  I believe that if the Princess saved her lover from the tiger, he would retry him and put a tiger behind both doors. The Story stated that the King was barbaric in nature so I feel he would make the Princess ",Seminar
Part 1  I believe that the tiger is behind the door.  I think the princess is barbaric and can't stand the thought of her lover with another.,Seminar
Part 1  I believe the tiger will be behind the door.  I think the princess is barbaric and won't be able to stand her lover with another.,Seminar
Part 2:  I don't think the King will do anything to the Princess.  He knows both choices would be punishment for her and her lover.,Seminar
"In addition, I was surprised the lover so quickly chose the right door after the princess signaled him.  He was willing to accept the fate that she chose.  I wonder if he knew what her choice would be.  I still don't think she would allow him to marry another, although that would be the choice I would make if I was in her shoes.",Seminar
"Part 1: If she loves him, the princess will lead her lover to the door that will allow him to live. If she allows greed and envy to cloud her judgement, she will likely lead her lover to his death.",Seminar
"I found myself conflicted for the princess. I always want a happy ending of some kind in the stories I read. However, it seems the princess loses either way in this story. If I were in her place, I would have allowed him to marry the woman rather than have him die a painful and bloody death.",Imaginative entry
 in being conflicted by happily ever after and greed. I chose the tiger behind the door because the story paints her out to be extremely jealous and barbaric.,Seminar
"It depends upon where the author wants to take the story. Given the princess's stealth and cunning in find out what was behind each door, I think she would rather see her lover dead than alive.",Seminar
"I agree with you Lillian Flores about it depending on someone, but I feel that it is up to the person reading the story and reflecting on the actions of the characters. In this case, the princess was jealous of the girl and she was also semi-barbaric like her father, so I feel she would have chosen the door with the tiger for the man. If I go with my own emotions, even though the author said not to base it on that, I would think that the princess would make the right choice with the right door and let him marry the man.  Although, would the man trust the princess enough and choose the same door as she indicated? So behind the right door would be the tiger.  They are both semibarbaric, so the King would most likely be disappointed at first, but either way, he got what he wanted and that was to keep his daughter away from this man. In this case, either sentence would be justice in his eyes.",Seminar
"I agree with both of you. To me, it is more likely that the princess would tell the man to open the door to the tiger. There was no mention of the princess questioning the morality of sending him to his death. In fact, it appeared like she was leaning towards it as the more merciful option because he would have a quick death and then be waiting for her in the afterlife. I think if she was going to send him to the other lady, she would have shown more guilt over the option of the tiger.",Seminar
Hi everyone! I think what happens next is that the princess let her lover marry the woman. The reason why I think she would do that is because she loves the man (as they had made each other the center of each others universe) and she would rather see him alive then feel guilty that she is the reason why he dies (she had nightmares of her lover being killed by the tiger). The king represent determinism and barbarism by having chance dictate one's choice (which he had demonstrated in the arena.)  The princess represented free will and progressivism because she actively went out of her way to know which door held which. I do not think a good lover will put harm's way to their love ones. The princess lost the man regardless of which door she choose but at least she can fulfill her role as a lover to never put harms way in his direction and not let the barbaric nature from her father's bloodline to overcome her moral compass.,Seminar
"Yes, I understand the princess hated the to-be-bride but I just can't see the princess letting her lover die when she went to find out which door led to what. Don't you guys think that symbolize the progressive nature of the princess compared to the king's barbarism where the king rather let chance decide than free will? I think the moral of the story is that we can inherit bad and good traits from one's parents but when it comes to determining who we are as a character, our actions tells more than genetics (as the princess has done when she sought info for the doors rather than let her lover relied on chance at the arena).",Seminar
*would not let the princess break the law in the first place.,Seminar
"Hi Rebecca Perez, I think you make an excellent point regarding the Princess representing progressivism and the Kind representing determinism. I believe that the Princess displayed qualities of progressivism from the very beginning; she choose who to love on her own accord which proves that she believes in free will and the importance of making your own decisions in life. With that being said, this is this very reason that I believe she sends her lover to the door of the tiger; she obviously believes in free will, but she still has semi-barbaric tendencies which may cause her to put her own free will above everyone else's.",Seminar
"My first thought was that the Princess would send her lover to the tiger (because she is like her father and seems to spend a lot more time dwelling on what would happen if he chose the door with the lady than what would happen if he got the tiger), but Michelle makes a good point - that she represents free will in opposition to her father (by finding out what was behind each door). I do think that a lot of this story rests in what the reader brings to it - whether the reader thinks that the Princess would send her lover to death or give him a life without her, depends upon the reader's perception of the world and of the context of the story, rather than just the story itself. Now, I do think that the King would alter the punishment for her daughter when he finds out that she broke the law, simply because he loves her so much and I don't think he would send her to the arena (although I think that would make a more interesting story in my opinion).",Seminar
"I think that she sends her lover to another woman. Even though the thought of him being with someone else is devastating, I don't think she could handle knowing that she  I was secretly hoping that the Princess would find a way to be the woman behind the door that I can't see her just setting him up to die! I think that the King would put his daughter through the system caused his death. I agree with the idea that we will all bring our own ideas to how we interpret the story; I have always been a Disney fantasyland"" sort of girl- true love conquers all and all that other stuff. But she took such a risk to love him  even if that meant changing his rules about who could court his daughter. As I was reading the story  defying her father and choosing true love over being a princess!""",Seminar
"Part One: The lover picks the door which the Princess indicates, and the beautiful courtier is revealed. The Princess grappled with her thoughts and instincts, feeling jealous and thinking about sending her lover to his death rather than see him with another woman.  She ended up indicating the door which held the beautiful woman because she realized that she couldn't live with the knowledge that she had sent her lover to his ruin.  Deciding that she would rather see him alive, she shows him which door to pick.",Seminar
"I think she tells him to go to the right but he goes to the left, finding the lady behind the door. In that moment realizes that she led him to his death. The Princess then has to face the fact that he found out she would rather see him dead than with the lady.",Seminar
"Part One: The princess seemed more threatened and bothered by the image of her lover going into the arms of another, than by the image of a tiger tearing him apart. I don't remember her exact words, but she thinks him dying quickly if the tiger is behind the door is a better fate for him. I'm not a fan of the barbaric ancestry and tendencies this text brings up, but it seems to be given as the reason for the King and Princess to act cruel and savagely. Therefore, I do think that that behind the door the Princess motioned to is the tiger. The story reads to me as if the Princess would rather have her lover to herself in perpetuity (in her mind) by killing him off now instead of see him with someone else.",Seminar
"Part One con't: Oops, sent the rest before finishing this thought. I think the lover goes to the door on the left instead of the door on the right, thinking on her barbaric"" nature and that she'd likely betray him  and finds a lady instead of the tiger. I'm assuming even though he knows her  it would leave him in shock knowing that the Princess would want him dead if she cannot keep him to herself.""",Seminar
"Part 1: I think that the princess will choose the door with the lady because even though she is jealous of her beauty, in the end she knows her lover loved her and could not live with the pain of killing her love. I also believe that the lover trusts her and chooses the door she picks, leaving him alive and married to the other lady.",Seminar
"Part one: I think the lover follows the Princess's instructions and opens the door on the right to the tiger. Based on how the Princess is described as barbaric"" like her father  I think the King sends his daughter into the tribunal as well. He seems set in his ways and seems to value power over logic."" and how she struggles between the two options of leading him to his death or leading him to a life. Part two: as mentioned earlier",Seminar
"Hi Kathryn Bell! I am curious to know why you think the lover would not follow the princess's instructions to open the door on the right? While the princess definitely felt untrustworthy to me, I did not get a sense that the lover felt that from her.",Seminar
"Part 1:  I believe that the Princess indicated for her lover to choose the door with the other lady behind it, because her love for him was strong.  Her relationship with him wasn't only passionate feelings, but truly a deep love, that is why it pained the Princess so much to think of her lover with another woman.  I believe that the young man trusted the Princess, because he knew her very well.  He knew that she would defy her father and find the answer to save him.  That's why he looked to her for help.  They knew each other very well.",Seminar
"Part 1: I believe that he chooses the door that the Princess gives him the hint to choose. When he opens the door, the lady is there because the Princess has love that very strong for him. She knows that she would rather know that he is alive and happy than send him to his end.",Seminar
Part 1: I think the princess hints to him the door with the lover. She is described as only semi barberous and so by having her show mercy to her former lover she provides a foil of free will to the Barbarous Kings fate based judicious system.,Seminar
"I feel that with the personalities traits provided to both the king and princess, she decided that death would be more appropriate than another woman, a rival, living happily with her lover. The princess was already wavering with deciding if he was faithful, so why would she give him and her rival the satisfaction? The lion seems to be the only choice for her disposition and upbringing.",Seminar
In part one I think he chose the princess because of her hints.  In part two she broke the rules so the king must be true to his role as leader and must trust fate and deal with his daughter how he would anyone else.,Seminar
"So it definitely seems like the princess hates the lady behind the door. But if it were me, I couldn't stand to see the man I love being eaten by a tiger.",Seminar
Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?,Seminar
"Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.",Seminar
"But it would be interesting if the princess's actions in breaking the law made her father realize just how much she loved the man (if she did tell him of the door with the lady). So maybe he could've used his influence to put her lover behind the door, that way he could still abide by his own law but also extend love to his daughter.",Seminar
Based on the princess' description I had almost expected her to not make any motion towards the door. I assumed she would take the same 'let Fate decide' attitude as the king,Seminar
