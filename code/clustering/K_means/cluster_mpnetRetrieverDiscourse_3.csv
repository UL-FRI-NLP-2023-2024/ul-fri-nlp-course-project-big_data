"(Sorry it came out as three separate messages! For some reason, it wouldn't post my full response at once.)",Seminar
"The more I think about this activity, the more I wonder if we are supposed to be collaboratively writing an end to the story. ",Deliberation
Perhaps the top of this page (where we type and send messages) is for planning and the bottom (open white area) is for writing an end to the story? ,UX
"I thought we could all answer the questions in the messaging area (like you & I did), then we can take turns drafting a group response",UX
"I could write the first draft based on my interpretation of our answers, then we could take turns editing - round robin style until we are happy with the result",Deliberation
What were your thoughts?,Deliberation
I am late to the discussion ,Procedure
because while I agree with the first part said,Seminar
We can try to get in touch with them and decide how we wat to write out the answer,Procedure
"I tried looking for a ""particpants"" button or something and I couldn't find one.",Procedure
"I sent an email to the coordinator and I hope to hear back from them, but I wouldn't mind setting up a discussion in our class page too",Procedure
I'm going to create a discussion called Book Club 4 and see if we can see if there is anyone else who is part of that group.,Procedure
I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.,Seminar
I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. ,Seminar
"As for Part 2, I have a theory. ",Seminar
That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.,Seminar
Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.,Deliberation
I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. ,Deliberation
Let's hope I do as well on part 2!!,Social
Any idea on how to submit it?,UX
Yeah I was wondering because when I click 'My Answer' at the top it says I haven't submitted one. ,UX
Maybe sometime next week there will be a button to push.,UX
Or when the survey comes out maybe something will be there,UX
"Part 1: Ultimately, it is left for the reader to decide what is behind the door,",Seminar
I hadn't thought of when I read the piece,Seminar
"Yeah, I was going back and forth a lot on what I think happened. So I can definitely see your reasoning for her picking the lady.",Seminar
"So, where have we landed: Lady or tiger? Trial or coverup? I think we just have to write something in the space below.","Seminar, Deliberation"
"Is the response we write in the field below supposed to be in the same style of the story, like we're completing it? Or are we just answering the questions?",Deliberation
I'm good with writing the majority choices.,Deliberation
"Unfortunately I can't click in the box below at all, so it's anyone's guess what style our response is supposed to be in. I would imagine answering the questions simply would be fine.",UX
Looks good. I think to mark our assignment done we just have to write SUBMITTED at the top of the entry.,UX
Wait how do we submit this assignment?,Deliberation
The four questions,Deliberation
Do we answer these before continuing the story?,Deliberation
"So the top is for chatting and the bottom is for responding, I believe.",Deliberation
"Ok, I had to reset the book to make this work!",Deliberation
"Yep, so what you think the questions are?",Deliberation
she was smiling by the end and the book told me i did well,Deliberation
Which questions? like the prompt?,Deliberation
But it asked for 4 so i amswered with 4,Deliberation
We need total four answers to the question,Deliberation
"At the top of the screen are two questions, I believe that is what the 1 & 2 are on the bottom portion",Deliberation
I tried the ones you mentioned it said try again.,Deliberation
You have to do them one at a time,Deliberation
The second question here is just as complex for different reasons,Seminar
there is a wrong answer?  thats weird,Deliberation
It is wrong because they want the character to respond to each question one at a time.,UX
Should we write it as continuing the story or just as a normal response?,Deliberation
it's I know I live without him final question,Seminar
Did you guys get the final question,Deliberation
I'm not sure what you mean by the final question. Once I put in the 4 questions it let me finish reading the last two pages.,UX
and then it just seems to end,UX
"Does anyone have any idea how to ""add the title SUBMITTED"" to our response?",UX
Also feel free to add anything to them if you would like.,Deliberation
I just added a title submitted so I guess we're done. This was very interesting and challenging.,Deliberation
Don't forget we have to go on to canvas and complete the survey and submit it,Deliberation
"We can continue to discuss individually, or if you want to try writing collaboratively at the same time, please suggest a time. I'm available any evening this week starting at 6 p.m. I'll keep tabs on here from now on to see if you want to do that. Thanks, Robyn",Procedure
I don't think I should have gone outside this platform to Google the book since this is supposed to be a discussion between us via this platform. Sorry about that.,Deliberation
"Cheryl Diaz, you bring up a good point - are we truly using the information gained through the reading or our own beliefs that human nature is fundamentally selfish. You really have me thinking about this.",Seminar
"Since we have each answered the two questions that were proposed, maybe choosing a day/time to all discuss our final answer to the prompt would be best. I am pretty flexible and am available today-thursday just about all day.",Procedure
"Dr. Austin said have fun with it, and it is fun to ponder what might happen in the story. I think the main reason for setting a time to discuss it at the same time would be to test the collaborative software, using the box below instead of this one. I believe we could all write in it at the same time and see each other typing and change each other's words until we all agree we are done with our assessment. If we are able to do that, we might find there are unexpected positives or negatives to the collaboration process or system that we can only otherwise surmise. As you say, we've all responded to the prompts, so what we say doesn't matter that much, so all we'd need is a few minutes to see how using the box works. So if you want to try meeting, I could do Wednesday any time of day. Just set a time and I'll log on then. Thanks.",Procedure
"Hi. I'm not sure if we were supposed to ultimately write an ending to the story or just answer the prompts collectively. I wrote an ending below, and you can change it or replace it. We just want to test the use of the space at the same time, I think.",Procedure
Do you see what I typed in the box below?,Procedure
I did this assignment twice last semester. I think they are just trying to get feedback on how it works/doesn't work. If the prompts and/or grouping is sufficient.,Procedure
"Oh, yay! Can you type a few words in there so I can see if they appear in real time? Then I think we can sign off.",Procedure
Looks good! I guess we can complete the post survey and submit our assignment,"Social, Procedure"
"I added a brief ending. If everyone is good with it, lets hit submit",Deliberation
Hi everyone! I have read the story and am ready to discuss.  I can log back in later to see if anyone else is ready.  Should we try to figure out a time to all come back and work in here together?,Procedure
"I read the story and I am ready for discussion too. Let's decide on a mutual time for this. Thanks,",Procedure
Can we plan on Tuesday the 23rd at 8pm to all meet back here to discuss and answer? Thanks,Procedure
"So, we discuss the prompt here and then write it together in the box below?",Procedure
"Yes. and honestly, the first time I read the prompt I thought we were just answering the questions in a method of critical thinking question. Now I am wondering if we are supposed to write an ending",Procedure
Good point. I thought the same thing about how to answer the questions.,Procedure
It really could be interpreted either way. Just answer questions or write an ending . . . .,Deliberation
"Yes, potentially something for the research team to work on clarifying....",Deliberation
How much longer would you like to wait for Julie before we begin? 5 more minutes?,Procedure
"If you can I can, or we could start and she could catch up?",Procedure
"I hope she's not back on one of the earlier pages, I just went back to reference and clicked the discussion and was left with a blank page, all these messages were not there.",Procedure
"So, what do you think about the questions?",Deliberation
"Ok, so what happens then? Do we choose which door she opens?",Deliberation
Are we all supposed to write our answers below?,Deliberation
"Yes, I think so. We were discussing if we write it like answers or finish the story? Thoughts?",Deliberation
"Good question Julie, we were discussing before you logged on, we are not quite sure if the prompt is looking for just the answers or an ending to be written",Deliberation
I'm not sure about the ending if we pick the door for her...personally as a (casual) author I would not want to pick an ending in this case,Deliberation
Okay so maybe we could each write out an answer for the first part of the question and then we edit the response into one?,Deliberation
"Ok, that works for me. We can just answer the questions.",Deliberation
...then the same for the second part?,Deliberation
Is the second sentence for part 2 okay?,Seminar
I like it. It draws from the story.,Seminar
"So, we title it SUBMITTED and that's it, right?",Deliberation
"Yes, I believe so and then fill out the survey thing back on canvas saying we completed the assignment. And that's it right?",Deliberation
"Yes, and I know that we are going with just answering but should you want to see an ending I was messing around with I would gladly share (we don't have to submit that necessarily)",Deliberation
I believe that is all the survey and canvas yes,Procedure
Yes it fits well with the story,Deliberation
We could leave it in if you want. We've answered the questions and then some. I don't think it would hurt. What do you girls think?,Deliberation
"If you would like, we can leave both our answers and your ending. That way we have both options covered. But if you'd rather not that's okay too.",Deliberation
"I agree, Linda Long. If you are okay with that, Michelle Rivera?",Deliberation
"I feel the flow doesn't entirely match the original story, but I felt it was awkwardly written and okay. We can add (ending) before it?",Deliberation
I say leave it in. It's well-written and adds depth to the answers.,Deliberation
Good with the parentheses?,Deliberation
Good idea. And I agree that original story was very awkwardly written. The syntax was strange.,Seminar
"It might not add to the style in which it was written, but what you predicted to happen fits well with the story in my opinion",Seminar
I agree Linda Long. It makes logical sense as a conclusion based on previous events in the story.,Seminar
"Well, the title of the story is a question - one that may never be answered. I think that was deliberate.",Seminar
I have never heard this story before... and I was wondering if it is some kind of folk tale?  Has anyone else seen this story before and do you know what culture it is from?,Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I actually had the same question as I had never heard this story before. So I did some research! This short story was written by Frank Stockton in 1882. Stockton wrote a follow up to this story called The Discourager of Hesitancy. He seems to like open-ended stories like these.,Seminar
"Thanks for the info and research, I was wondering about this story as well. I've never read it before.",Seminar
I can't see when people are online but I can see that you've checked the book recently,UX
I can't see anyone either unless they write a message.,UX
"I just asked Samantha if this activity is timed or if we need to spend a certain amount of time in the chat, Samantha said we can take as long as we want",Procedure
"Okay, cool! Should we wait a couple of minutes for Rebecca or get started?",Social
I don't think this e-book times out so we should be ok,UX
"it says Alexandrea, Matthew and Sara looked at this 18 days ago. How is this possible? I thought the activity just opened up this week?",UX
"So regarding part 1 of the question, I think the lady is behind the door!",Seminar
That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending,Seminar
Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.,UX
"Oh yeah Rebecca, in order to get past page 8, you have to form 5 questions with the tiles on bottom of screen",UX
I tried to read it before 7 but it's stuck on that one part,UX
"Oh, yeah! You make up the questions and then can advance!",UX
"Yeah I put questions, I'll refresh and try again",UX
"Each time you submit, the lady talks back to you and her icon changes.",UX
It doesn't matter the combo of the questions,UX
"Ok it's finally working. I'll read the next part quickly and then I'll be good to keep going. Sorry guys, thanks for your help",UX
That was in response to Rebecca's question.,Seminar
"Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?",Seminar
I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?,Seminar
Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.,Seminar
I guess that was all we had to do? I don't know if there's anything else to discuss,Procedure
I also found the story confusing and I had to re-read it several times,Seminar
I guess the ending depends on how everyone interprets it,Seminar
I'm so sorry to have missed this initial conversation. I was dealing with some personal matters that prevented me from doing so. But I've caught up and I greatly enjoyed reading the discourse here.,Social
I had similar issues reading the writing style. It took a few times to really get to the core of what was being said.,Seminar
