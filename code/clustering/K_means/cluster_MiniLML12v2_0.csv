"However, I also do not",Seminar
"(Sorry it came out as three separate messages! For some reason, it wouldn't post my full response at once.)",Seminar
Perhaps the top of this page (where we type and send messages) is for planning and the bottom (open white area) is for writing an end to the story? ,UX
I'm overall a little confused by this entire module ,Deliberation
"I thought we could all answer the questions in the messaging area (like you & I did), then we can take turns drafting a group response",UX
"I could write the first draft based on my interpretation of our answers, then we could take turns editing - round robin style until we are happy with the result",Deliberation
Thanks for taking the lead on the first draft,Social
Iâ€™ll check in soon and add to it ,Procedure
I am late to the discussion ,Procedure
but I figured I might as well add to this,Procedure
Do we know how many people are part of this group? ,Procedure
We can try to get in touch with them and decide how we wat to write out the answer,Procedure
"I tried looking for a ""particpants"" button or something and I couldn't find one.",Procedure
"I sent an email to the coordinator and I hope to hear back from them, but I wouldn't mind setting up a discussion in our class page too",Procedure
You're here for LIS6303 or for another class?,Procedure
I'm also in LIS6303!,Procedure
I'm going to create a discussion called Book Club 4 and see if we can see if there is anyone else who is part of that group.,Procedure
"Also, I got an email letting us know that Elias Royal is also a part of our group. ",Procedure
(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing),Social
Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.,Deliberation
I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. ,Deliberation
Any idea on how to submit it?,UX
Yeah I was wondering because when I click 'My Answer' at the top it says I haven't submitted one. ,UX
So I don't know. ,UX
Maybe sometime next week there will be a button to push.,UX
Or when the survey comes out maybe something will be there,UX
"Unfortunately I can't click in the box below at all, so it's anyone's guess what style our response is supposed to be in. I would imagine answering the questions simply would be fine.",UX
"Oh good! I can, in fact, click in the box.",UX
Looks good. I think to mark our assignment done we just have to write SUBMITTED at the top of the entry.,UX
Wait how do we submit this assignment?,Deliberation
The four questions,Deliberation
"So the top is for chatting and the bottom is for responding, I believe.",Deliberation
"Yep, so what you think the questions are?",Deliberation
Which questions? like the prompt?,Deliberation
But it asked for 4 so i amswered with 4,Deliberation
We need total four answers to the question,Deliberation
"At the top of the screen are two questions, I believe that is what the 1 & 2 are on the bottom portion",Deliberation
I tried the ones you mentioned it said try again.,Deliberation
You have to do them one at a time,Deliberation
I tried them all at once and it told me wrong lol,Deliberation
I'm try again.,Deliberation
Any additions?,Deliberation
keeping one's orbs in line is essential,Seminar
Hey guys I got through the next page,Deliberation
it's I know I live without him final question,Seminar
im just back at the screen we were at before,UX
"Does anyone have any idea how to ""add the title SUBMITTED"" to our response?",UX
i do not,UX
I was looking for that,UX
Also feel free to add anything to them if you would like.,Deliberation
What did you have to do?,Deliberation
Don't forget we have to go on to canvas and complete the survey and submit it,Deliberation
"We can continue to discuss individually, or if you want to try writing collaboratively at the same time, please suggest a time. I'm available any evening this week starting at 6 p.m. I'll keep tabs on here from now on to see if you want to do that. Thanks, Robyn",Procedure
"Since we have each answered the two questions that were proposed, maybe choosing a day/time to all discuss our final answer to the prompt would be best. I am pretty flexible and am available today-thursday just about all day.",Procedure
I can meet tomorrow (Wednesday) at 9am EST/8CST.,Procedure
Do you see what I typed in the box below?,Procedure
I did this assignment twice last semester. I think they are just trying to get feedback on how it works/doesn't work. If the prompts and/or grouping is sufficient.,Procedure
"Oh, yay! Can you type a few words in there so I can see if they appear in real time? Then I think we can sign off.",Procedure
"Sorry, i see you comment now.",Procedure
"Thanks. I apologize for delaying you on completing this assignment, but I appreciate your taking the extra time for me. Good luck with the rest of the semester!",Social
Looks good! I guess we can complete the post survey and submit our assignment,"Social, Procedure"
"I added a brief ending. If everyone is good with it, lets hit submit",Deliberation
"Apologies for my slacking with this, I am also finished now.",Social
Can we plan on Tuesday the 23rd at 8pm to all meet back here to discuss and answer? Thanks,Procedure
"I just replied to the email, but yes"" I can meet back here tomorrow (Tues. at 8pm). ""See"" you all then!""",Procedure
"Hi Linda Long and Michelle Rivera, I am here and ready whenever you both are.",Procedure
"So, we discuss the prompt here and then write it together in the box below?",Procedure
Good point. I thought the same thing about how to answer the questions.,Procedure
How much longer would you like to wait for Julie before we begin? 5 more minutes?,Procedure
"If you can I can, or we could start and she could catch up?",Procedure
"I hope she's not back on one of the earlier pages, I just went back to reference and clicked the discussion and was left with a blank page, all these messages were not there.",Procedure
"So, what do you think about the questions?",Deliberation
Sorry for the delay,Social
"Good question Julie, we were discussing before you logged on, we are not quite sure if the prompt is looking for just the answers or an ending to be written",Deliberation
Okay so maybe we could each write out an answer for the first part of the question and then we edit the response into one?,Deliberation
"Ok, that works for me. We can just answer the questions.",Deliberation
"Yes, I believe so and then fill out the survey thing back on canvas saying we completed the assignment. And that's it right?",Deliberation
Good with the parentheses?,Deliberation
