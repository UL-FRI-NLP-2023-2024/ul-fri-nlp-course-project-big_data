"We can continue to discuss individually, or if you want to try writing collaboratively at the same time, please suggest a time. I'm available any evening this week starting at 6 p.m. I'll keep tabs on here from now on to see if you want to do that. Thanks, Robyn",Procedure
I don't think I should have gone outside this platform to Google the book since this is supposed to be a discussion between us via this platform. Sorry about that.,Deliberation
"Since we have each answered the two questions that were proposed, maybe choosing a day/time to all discuss our final answer to the prompt would be best. I am pretty flexible and am available today-thursday just about all day.",Procedure
"Dr. Austin said have fun with it, and it is fun to ponder what might happen in the story. I think the main reason for setting a time to discuss it at the same time would be to test the collaborative software, using the box below instead of this one. I believe we could all write in it at the same time and see each other typing and change each other's words until we all agree we are done with our assessment. If we are able to do that, we might find there are unexpected positives or negatives to the collaboration process or system that we can only otherwise surmise. As you say, we've all responded to the prompts, so what we say doesn't matter that much, so all we'd need is a few minutes to see how using the box works. So if you want to try meeting, I could do Wednesday any time of day. Just set a time and I'll log on then. Thanks.",Procedure
I can meet tomorrow (Wednesday) at 9am EST/8CST.,Procedure
"Perfect. ""See"" you then.",Procedure
"Oh, yay! Can you type a few words in there so I can see if they appear in real time? Then I think we can sign off.",Procedure

"I just replied to the email, but yes"" I can meet back here tomorrow (Tues. at 8pm). ""See"" you all then!""",Procedure
"Hi Linda Long and Michelle Rivera, I am here and ready whenever you both are.",Procedure
"I am on,",Procedure
"Ok, that's how I understand it as well. Let's wait a few more minutes to give Julie a chance to join us. Sound good?",Procedure
How much longer would you like to wait for Julie before we begin? 5 more minutes?,Procedure
"If you can I can, or we could start and she could catch up?",Procedure
