"The more I think about this activity, the more I wonder if we are supposed to be collaboratively writing an end to the story. ",Deliberation
I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.,Seminar
I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. ,Seminar
That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.,Seminar
I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. ,Deliberation
That's some amazing writing! ,Social
I hadn't thought of when I read the piece,Seminar
"Is the response we write in the field below supposed to be in the same style of the story, like we're completing it? Or are we just answering the questions?",Deliberation
Do we answer these before continuing the story?,Deliberation
"Ok, I had to reset the book to make this work!",Deliberation
she was smiling by the end and the book told me i did well,Deliberation
Should we write it as continuing the story or just as a normal response?,Deliberation
and then it just seems to end,UX
I just added a title submitted so I guess we're done. This was very interesting and challenging.,Deliberation
"Hi. I'm not sure if we were supposed to ultimately write an ending to the story or just answer the prompts collectively. I wrote an ending below, and you can change it or replace it. We just want to test the use of the space at the same time, I think.",Procedure
"I added a brief ending. If everyone is good with it, lets hit submit",Deliberation
"I read the story and I am ready for discussion too. Let's decide on a mutual time for this. Thanks,",Procedure
"Yes. and honestly, the first time I read the prompt I thought we were just answering the questions in a method of critical thinking question. Now I am wondering if we are supposed to write an ending",Procedure
It really could be interpreted either way. Just answer questions or write an ending . . . .,Deliberation
"Yes, I think so. We were discussing if we write it like answers or finish the story? Thoughts?",Deliberation
"Good question Julie, we were discussing before you logged on, we are not quite sure if the prompt is looking for just the answers or an ending to be written",Deliberation
I'm not sure about the ending if we pick the door for her...personally as a (casual) author I would not want to pick an ending in this case,Deliberation
I like it. It draws from the story.,Seminar
"Yes, and I know that we are going with just answering but should you want to see an ending I was messing around with I would gladly share (we don't have to submit that necessarily)",Deliberation
Yes it fits well with the story,Deliberation
"I feel the flow doesn't entirely match the original story, but I felt it was awkwardly written and okay. We can add (ending) before it?",Deliberation
Good idea. And I agree that original story was very awkwardly written. The syntax was strange.,Seminar
"It might not add to the style in which it was written, but what you predicted to happen fits well with the story in my opinion",Seminar
I agree Linda Long. It makes logical sense as a conclusion based on previous events in the story.,Seminar
"Well, the title of the story is a question - one that may never be answered. I think that was deliberate.",Seminar
"I enjoyed reading all of your perspectives.  Nicole Gonzalez- I also found the idea of barbarism"" kind of unsettling... I guess it was a pretty common theme in story telling in the ""old  but reading from my 21st century perspective days""  it feels like labeling the society as ""other"" or ""bad"".""",Seminar
I have never heard this story before... and I was wondering if it is some kind of folk tale?  Has anyone else seen this story before and do you know what culture it is from?,Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I actually had the same question as I had never heard this story before. So I did some research! This short story was written by Frank Stockton in 1882. Stockton wrote a follow up to this story called The Discourager of Hesitancy. He seems to like open-ended stories like these.,Seminar
"Thanks for the info and research, I was wondering about this story as well. I've never read it before.",Seminar
That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending,Seminar
Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.,UX
"Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?",Seminar
I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?,Seminar
Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.,Seminar
I also found the story confusing and I had to re-read it several times,Seminar
I guess the ending depends on how everyone interprets it,Seminar
I had similar issues reading the writing style. It took a few times to really get to the core of what was being said.,Seminar
