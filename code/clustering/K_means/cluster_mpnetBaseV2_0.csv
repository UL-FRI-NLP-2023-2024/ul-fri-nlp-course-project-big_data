"Her lover would die and never love another."" ",Seminar
"Either way she must love without him, but is she open-hearted enough to allow for him to love another?",Seminar
"It doesn't appear so. For instance, she discloses great agony, jealousy, and stress about the potential wedding between her lover and the lady behind the door;",Seminar
"more upset with the prospect of him belonging to another, and so it is clear,",Seminar
"given the two terrible choices,",Seminar
imagine this to be the catalyst that ends his idea of public punishment. ,Seminar
The story also leads me to think that she is accustomed to having her every wish granted by her father and that she never learned the benefits of compassion.,Seminar
"If the secret was shared with the community, I also think that it would be her informant that would be punished.",Seminar
I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an ,Seminar
I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an opportunity for the king to re-examine the practice.,Seminar
What were your thoughts?,Deliberation
" I have to say, the line of thinking is still technically flawed.",Seminar
Love does have a way of changing how we think and make valuable decisions like this one,Seminar
"While Jealousy is a strong determinate, Love is often stronger, and it would make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make",Seminar
make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make sense for her to have him killed. ,Seminar
Basing a decision on her lineage is not exactly a strong source in my opinion.,Seminar
"However, basing a decision on her own thought process, that I can get behind",Seminar
had great grief over her lover in anotherâ€™s arms.,Seminar
"As for the second part, only her lover saw her give the signal so the second part is questionable as it would be based on hearsay. ",Seminar
"Without someone seeing her give the signal, they really cannot accuse her of helping him",Seminar
"Not to mention that if she had not helped him at all, and he opened the door with the female, would she still be under scrutiny?",Seminar
Do you think that she kills him or saves him?,Seminar
What would you do in her place?,Imaginative entry
"I kind of think that even though she is angry and jealous, she would ultimately save him. ",Seminar
I think that overall the weight of her conscious would have kept her from sending him to his death for falling in love with her.,Seminar
Perhaps he planned it so that she would be the one to make the decision in the end as no one has ever known what's behind the doors before,Seminar
Maybe this was her punishment.,Seminar
"Knowing she could save him from death, but still lose him in the end.",Seminar
I'm kind of on the fence about whether she saves him or not.,Seminar
 I think that she may dislike the idea that he marries another more than him dying.,Seminar
What would you do in her place?,Imaginative entry
"Not what do you think she would do, but what would you do if you were in the situation? ",Imaginative entry
I know I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I was the reason the person I loved was killed in such a painful manner,Imaginative entry
 It would hurt worse to know his death was my fault than to know that he was happy with someone else. ,Imaginative entry
I think I'd find it easier to move on and live if he was still alive.,Imaginative entry
I mean there are other guys out there after all.,Imaginative entry
" Personally, I would save him. ",Imaginative entry
"I'd rather be sad for a little while that the person I loved married someone else, than let them get killed. ",Imaginative entry
I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.,Imaginative entry
"There are other guys out there so even if he was the most handsome and all that,",Imaginative entry
I'm sure I would eventually get over him being with someone else,Imaginative entry
But I'm not sure how this princess would think.,Seminar
So how do you guys think we should end it?,Deliberation
"I'm honestly okay with either ending, ",Deliberation
I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.,Seminar
"How do you think it should end, Emilie?",Seminar
about how she may have felt guilty.,Seminar
That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.,Seminar
 The abyss of pain and betrayal of an unfaithful lover and seeing them with someone else is palpable and I could imagine that in the throngs of that deep pain one might wish their unfaithful lover to be dead.,Seminar
"Yeah, I was going back and forth a lot on what I think happened. So I can definitely see your reasoning for her picking the lady.",Seminar
She's definitely her father's child.,Seminar
"Live without was the first one I put.  Then Trust, Love, and then Know",Deliberation
Live Without Him is probably the most important question,Deliberation
I feel like it would be the opposite because she went to all the hassle to find out.,Seminar
I am under the impression that she would rather see him dead than in the arms of another woman.,Seminar
or maybe he put her behind one of the doors!,Seminar
it's I know I live without him final question,Seminar
Oh that would be a good punishment for her!,Seminar
I know live without him,Deliberation
since she will lose him anyway*,Seminar
"lol no, it just seemed like what happened based on her father, and her own jealous nature",Seminar
"Yes, she did seem very jealous. The story led me to believe she would rather nobody have him if she could not.",Seminar
"from my thoughts I thought yes, he sets up 2 doors for her and lets the trial decide.",Seminar
Should we mention that love didn't weigh in to either of their decisions?,Seminar
"I'm not sure how to word it, but I think their barbaric nature made them irrational and maybe incapable of love? Something like that...",Seminar
"Maybe not to enough of a degree not to put her to trial...but he does love her, just like to a degree she loved the man",Seminar
He was tied to his own idealistic principles?,Seminar
I agree Linda Long. It makes logical sense as a conclusion based on previous events in the story.,Seminar
 but maybe he's the only one who knows what she did?,Seminar
"Maybe I'm a skeptic, but I'm not convinced she sends him on to live his happily ever after with another woman.  There's a whole paragraph on the last page about how the whole idea of that tormented here. And she asks Would it not be better for him to die at once  and go to wait for her in the blessed regions of semi-barbaric futurity?""",Seminar
Marry the girl not the man.,Seminar
That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending,Seminar
"If she really loves him, she should want him to be with someone else and alive rather than dead!",Seminar
I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :),Seminar
There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?,Seminar
I guess the ending depends on how everyone interprets it,Seminar
