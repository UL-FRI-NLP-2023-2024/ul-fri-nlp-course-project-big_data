pim-01,Hello. ,,Social,,1,,,,,,,
pim-01,My assumption is,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,Social to Seminar,
pim-01,that the emphasis on barbarism implies that she sent him to the lion.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-03,I agree with Cassandra's noticing ,,Seminar,,1,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-03,of the author's word choice of barbarism.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-02,I loved the addition of ,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-02,"Her lover would die and never love another."" ",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-02," Sadly  the barbaric nature of the king and princess is still alive today in crimes of passion.""",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,Seminar to Procedure,
pim-03,Submitted,,Procedure,,,,,,,,Procedure to Seminar,
pim-06,"If the princess possesses the same semi-barbaric trait as her father, then it would seem she directed her lover to the door with the tiger. ",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,"Either way she must love without him, but is she open-hearted enough to allow for him to love another?",,Seminar,,1,,,,C-HOT,,,
pim-06,"It doesn't appear so. For instance, she discloses great agony, jealousy, and stress about the potential wedding between her lover and the lady behind the door;",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,"however, she only comments that a tiger would bring shrieks and blood. From her revealed thoughts, she is ",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,mor,,,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,"more upset with the prospect of him belonging to another, and so it is clear,",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,"given the two terrible choices,",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,she would send him to his death.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,If the King were to discover that his daughter broke the law by secretly sending her lover towards the door on the right,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,he would have to send his daughter to the arena for a judgement. ,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,"I would imagine,",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,"given that it is stressed he is semi-barbaric, he would choose not to send his daughter, whom he loves so dearly, to her potential death.",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,"However, I also do not",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,ima,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,imagine this to be the catalyst that ends his idea of public punishment. ,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,"Perhaps, instead of sending his daughter to the arena, he would send the person who gave her the information about the two doors instead.",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06, It could be argued that the informant is more guilty than the princess and is sent to show the kingdom the consequence of such behaviors.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-06,"(Sorry it came out as three separate messages! For some reason, it wouldn't post my full response at once.)",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04,I agree with Ashely ,,Seminar,,1,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-04, that the Princess's barbaric traits will lead the princess to send her lover to his death.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04,"She exhibits immaturity and cruelty by fixating on imagined flirtations between ""the lady"" and the princess's lover.",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04,The story also leads me to think that she is accustomed to having her every wish granted by her father and that she never learned the benefits of compassion.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04,I also agree with Ashley,,Seminar,,1,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-04,that the king's adoration of his daughter would stop him from sending his daughter into the arena.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04,"I had orgininally thought that the king would either keep her secret out of love for his daughter, or out of barbaric pride that she sent her lover to his grizzly death, or a combination of the two. ",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04,"If the secret was shared with the community, I also think that it would be her informant that would be punished.",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04,I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an ,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04,opportun,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04,I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an opportunity for the king to re-examine the practice.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-04, I like this idea!,,Seminar,,1,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-06,"The more I think about this activity, the more I wonder if we are supposed to be collaboratively writing an end to the story. ",,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,Seminar to Deliberation,
pim-06,Perhaps the top of this page (where we type and send messages) is for planning and the bottom (open white area) is for writing an end to the story? ,,Deliberation,,2,,,,C-LOT,,,
pim-06,I'm overall a little confused by this entire module ,,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,,
pim-06,and am open to other thoughts/suggestions.,,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,,
pim-04,"I think you are correct, Ashley. ",,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,,
pim-04,"I thought we could all answer the questions in the messaging area (like you & I did), then we can take turns drafting a group response",,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,,
pim-04,"I could write the first draft based on my interpretation of our answers, then we could take turns editing - round robin style until we are happy with the result",,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,,
pim-04,What were your thoughts?,,Deliberation,,2,,,,O-HOT,,,
pim-06,"That sounds great, Meg! ",,Social,,2,,,,,,Deliberation to Social,
pim-06,Thanks for taking the lead on the first draft,,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-06,I‚Äôll check in soon and add to it ,,Procedure,,2,,,,,,Social to Procedure,
pim-06,üëç,,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-04,SUBMITTED,,Procedure,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,I am late to the discussion ,,Procedure,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,but I figured I might as well add to this,,Procedure,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,because while I agree with the first part said,,Seminar,,,,,,,,Procedure to Seminar,
pim-05," I have to say, the line of thinking is still technically flawed.",,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,Just because she comes from a semi-barbaric King does not make her semi-barbaric. ,,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,Love does have a way of changing how we think and make valuable decisions like this one,,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,"While Jealousy is a strong determinate, Love is often stronger, and it would make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make",,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,s,,,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make sense for her to have him killed. ,,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,Basing a decision on her lineage is not exactly a strong source in my opinion.,,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,"However, basing a decision on her own thought process, that I can get behind",,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,and Meg brought and interesting topic of the difference between how the princess rambles on about him opening the door with the lady but barely mentions him opening the door with the tiger.,,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,The princess has no qualms about her lover dying but,,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,had great grief over her lover in another‚Äôs arms.,,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,"As for the second part, only her lover saw her give the signal so the second part is questionable as it would be based on hearsay. ",,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05, Would the king even entertain that idea given it is his daughter?,,Seminar,,,,,,C-HOT,,,
pim-05,Who knows? ,,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,"Without someone seeing her give the signal, they really cannot accuse her of helping him",,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-05,"Not to mention that if she had not helped him at all, and he opened the door with the female, would she still be under scrutiny?",,Seminar,,,,,,C-HOT,,,
pim-05,What would happen then?,,Seminar,,,,,,C-HOT,,,
pim-09,uwgyeu,,,,,,,,,,,
pim-09,"Part 1: For this question, our team decided that the princess chose the door with the tiger. ",,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-09,"This is based on the story's emphasis on the royal family's semi barbaric"" nature.",,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-09," In the story  it is mentioned several times that the princess is jealous of the idea of her lover being with another woman  stating ""her soul had burned in agony when he rushed to meet that woman"" (pp. 10).",,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-09,This action seems indicitive of her barbaric and jealous nature because this way she remains the conquerer  and if she cannot,,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
pim-09,"ha""",,,,,,,,,,,
pim-11,What do you guys think? ,,Seminar,,1,,,,O-HOT,,,
pim-11,Do you think that she kills him or saves him?,,Seminar,,1,,,,C-HOT,,,
pim-11,What would you do in her place?,,Imaginative entry,,1,,,,O-HOT,,Seminar to Imaginative entry,
pim-11,"I kind of think that even though she is angry and jealous, she would ultimately save him. ",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,Imaginative entry to Seminar,
pim-11,I think that overall the weight of her conscious would have kept her from sending him to his death for falling in love with her.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-11,"After all, it is a two way road and she is being punished right along with him for getting caught by the king as well.",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-11, I also think that even if the king finds out that she knew the doors he will know that either choice that she makes is a punishment in its own right. She suffers either way ,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-11,w,,,,1,,,,,,,
pim-11,And what if the king already knew that she had broken the law. ,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-11,Perhaps he planned it so that she would be the one to make the decision in the end as no one has ever known what's behind the doors before,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-11,Maybe this was her punishment.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-11,"Knowing she could save him from death, but still lose him in the end.",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-11,It would be just a thing that this King would do I think.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-12,"Kyra, those are some good thoughts! ",,Seminar,,1,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-12,I'm kind of on the fence about whether she saves him or not.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-12, I think that she may dislike the idea that he marries another more than him dying.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-12,So I'm leaning more toward she sends him to the tiger's door.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-12,But I do also think that it is possible that the King could be in on it too. ,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-12,He could know that she knows which door is which and he seems like the type of king to enjoy that punishment,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-11,Emilie I can see that. ,,Seminar,,1,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-11,What would you do in her place?,,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,O-HOT,,Seminar to Imaginative entry,
pim-11,"Not what do you think she would do, but what would you do if you were in the situation? ",,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,O-HOT,,,
pim-11,I know I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I was the reason the person I loved was killed in such a painful manner,,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11, It would hurt worse to know his death was my fault than to know that he was happy with someone else. ,,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,I think I'd find it easier to move on and live if he was still alive.,,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,I mean there are other guys out there after all.,,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,I agree.,,Imaginative entry,,2,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-12," Personally, I would save him. ",,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,"I'd rather be sad for a little while that the person I loved married someone else, than let them get killed. ",,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.,,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,And that's true! ,,Imaginative entry,,2,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-12,"There are other guys out there so even if he was the most handsome and all that,",,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,I'm sure I would eventually get over him being with someone else,,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,"I think if I misled him to choose the tiger's door, I would feel like I committed a murder myself",,Imaginative entry,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,I agree with that so much! ,,Imaginative entry,,2,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-11,But I'm not sure how this princess would think.,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,Imaginative entry to Seminar,
pim-11,Do we know how many people are part of this group? ,,Procedure,,3,,,,C-LOT,,Seminar to Procedure,
pim-11,We can try to get in touch with them and decide how we wat to write out the answer,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-12,I'm not sure! ,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-12,"I tried looking for a ""particpants"" button or something and I couldn't find one.",,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-11,I couldn't either.,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-11,"I sent an email to the coordinator and I hope to hear back from them, but I wouldn't mind setting up a discussion in our class page too",,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-11,You're here for LIS6303 or for another class?,,Procedure,,3,,,,C-LOT,,,
pim-12,I'm also in LIS6303!,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-11,okay awesome! ,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-11,I'm going to create a discussion called Book Club 4 and see if we can see if there is anyone else who is part of that group.,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-12,Good idea!,,Social,,3,,,,,,Procedure to Social,
pim-12,So how do you guys think we should end it?,,Deliberation,,2,,,,O-HOT,,Social to Deliberation,
pim-11,"I'm honestly okay with either ending, ",,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,but I think we should incorporate the King mentioning that he helped feed his daughter the information on what was behind each door. ,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,Deliberation to Seminar,
pim-11,That's just my opinion though.,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,"Also, I got an email letting us know that Elias Royal is also a part of our group. ",,Procedure,,3,,,,,,Seminar to Procedure,
pim-11,I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.,,Seminar,,3,,,,,,Procedure to Seminar,
pim-11,"How do you think it should end, Emilie?",,Seminar,,2,,,,O-HOT,,,
pim-12,"Of course, we should all definitely have a chance to contribute.",,Procedure,,2,,,,,,Seminar to Procedure,
pim-12,I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. ,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,Procedure to Seminar,
pim-12,My initial thoughts were that the princess knows what's behind each of the doors because the King had told her or she figured it out from overhearing him talk about the punishment.,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,"I also got the sense that she would point her lover to the tiger's door, but now the more that I think about it, I think she would send him to the other woman.",,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,I liked what you mentioned earlier Kyra,,Seminar,,2,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-12,about how she may have felt guilty.,,Seminar,,2,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-12,"As for Part 2, I have a theory. ",,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,"I think that when the King discovers his daughter broke the law, he would still make her go through the arena.",,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,"BUT, he'd tell her which door leads to a man and which leads to the tiger, thinking that she will obviously choose to marry and live.",,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,"HOWEVER, she is so distraught about losing the love of her life that she actually chooses the tiger's door on purpose.",,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,This could either cause the King to become even more barbaric or to stop these trials all together,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,But that's just what I was thinking.,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12, I'm definitely okay with another approach that we can all agree on,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,Oooo I like that idea of how he might send her to the arena and then tell her which is behind each door. ,,Seminar,,2,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-11,"This gives her a chance at potential happiness or, if she is feeling miserable and depressed, may want to go through with the tiger!",,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,And I almost think if we can't decide we might just flip a coin ,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,lol ,,Social,,2,,,,,,Seminar to Social,
pim-11,(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing),,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.,,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,"Flipping a coin may not be the worst idea, honestly! ",,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,Social to Deliberation,
pim-12,I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. ,,Deliberation,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,That's fun,,Social,,2,,,,,,Deliberation to Social,
pim-11,Glad you like that idea ,,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,:D,,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,I think it would be fun too!,,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,"Oooo I have another idea! What if the princess sends the man to the tiger and right out tells her father she did it and wants a trial. Then because he loves her he begs her to choose the door with the young man he picks for her, but she chooses the tiger.",,Seminar,,2,,,,,,Social to Seminar,
pim-12,That's a creative idea!,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12, I like it,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,"Kyra, I LOVE what you did for part 1!! ",,Social,,2,,,,,,Seminar to Social,
pim-12,That's some amazing writing! ,,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,Let's hope I do as well on part 2!!,,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,Awww thank you so much!,,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,Ahhh I love your response too!,,Social,,2,,,,,,,
pim-12,Finished! How does that sound?,,Seminar,,2,,,,O-LOT,,Social to Seminar,
pim-11,it's wonderful!,,Seminar,,2,,,,,,,
pim-11,Any idea on how to submit it?,,Procedure,,3,,,,C-LOT,,Seminar to Procedure,
pim-12,I think we just leave it here? I'm not totally sure,,Procedure,,3,,,,C-LOT,,,
pim-11,Yeah I was wondering because when I click 'My Answer' at the top it says I haven't submitted one. ,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-11,So I don't know. ,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-11,Maybe sometime next week there will be a button to push.,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-12,Maybe! ,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-12,Or when the survey comes out maybe something will be there,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-11,Yeah that makes sense.,,Procedure,,3,,,,,,,
pim-13,darla,,,,,,,,,,,
pim-13,"Part 1: Ultimately, it is left for the reader to decide what is behind the door,",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-13,and it would depend what they feel the princess cares about more - his life or him being married to another woman.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-13,He sentences her to the same trial.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-14,Part 1: It is such an agonizing question of whether the lady or the tiger is behind the door. ,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-14, The abyss of pain and betrayal of an unfaithful lover and seeing them with someone else is palpable and I could imagine that in the throngs of that deep pain one might wish their unfaithful lover to be dead.,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-14,I would hope though,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,

pim-14,"^Gina, that is a really interesting point that you make, ",,Seminar,,1,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-14,that he sentences the princess to the same trial that he is on. ,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-14,"The text describes the anxiety of being in a huge stadium with a roaring crowd and the fear of being killed horribly by a tiger, ",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-14,"but at the same time, as you stated, the princess is herself in a greater trial than the man in that she has to decide whether to kill or not kill her lover who has hurt so deeply.",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-14,"That's a really insightful point, Gina!",,Seminar,,1,,Affirm,,,,,
pim-14,I hadn't thought of when I read the piece,,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-13,"Hi John, ",,Social,,1,,,,,,Seminar to Social,
pim-13,"I feel that it would be fitting for the king to sentence her to the same trial, because they king and princess are both constantly described as semi-barbaric"" throughout the text.",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
pim-13,"There seems to be very little compassion or empathy displayed by the king or the princess  even when the princess thinks of her lover  she thinks of herself not necessarily him.""",,Seminar,,1,,,,,,,
Louise Campbell,"I think the lady is behind the door. If she truly loved him as the story seems to claim, she would not have wanted him mauled. Plus, if she wants a future with any man she wouldn‚Äôt want the world to see her first lover as someone who deserved to be punished.",Seminar,Seminar,Begin,Begin,,,,,,,
Louise Campbell,I honestly don‚Äôt think the king would have done anything after discovering his daughter broke the law. He probably covered it up or considered her already punished through her lovers fate.,Seminar,Seminar,¬†,,,,,,,,
Anna Jones,"I think the lady is behind the door. Regardless of how jealous you may be, you can't really love someone and also be able to tolerate watching them get torn apart by a wild animal.",Seminar,Seminar,¬†,,,,,,,,
Anna Jones,The King does seem unstable enough to put his daughter on trial via the lady and the tiger method. I imagine she'd use her own connections to find out which door had the tiger behind it and which door had a suitor.,Seminar,Seminar,¬†,,,Affirm,,,,,
Andrea Henderson,"I think the tiger was behind the door. Mostly because of the princess being described as ""hot-blooded and semi-barbaric.""",Seminar,Seminar,¬†,,Disagree,Disagree,,,,,
Andrea Henderson,"Louise Campbell, I agree with you in thinking that the king covered it up somehow and didn't put her through the trial.",Seminar,Seminar,¬†,,Affirm,Affirm,,,,,
Louise Campbell,"Anna Jones, this is what I was thinking. If you really loved him you wouldn‚Äôt allow that. Alexandra, I was leaning toward the tiger at first because of the descriptions you gave.

Earl Foster,"I think it would depend on how much she truly trust her lover. If she had faith in him truly, she would let him live with the lady. At least he would be alive and happy. But if she was full of distrust or jealousy she would kill her lover. Even if she is semi-barbaric she seems to be fair or at least a follower of her Father. I would say she would point to the Lady in the end.",Seminar,Seminar,¬†,,,Elaborate,,,,,

Karen Richardson,"I believe the lady was behind the door as the description of the princess was ""semi-barbaric.""

On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman?

It's clearly written that she loves him dearly, and his trustworthiness isn't something to consider so heavily since she will lose him heavily. I think she points him to the tiger because of how much more thought she put into the aftermath of sending him towards the lady. She laments on how horrifying it would be to watch her loved one die at the hands of ferocity, but laments even more at the thought of watching him live a different life with someone other than her. She even gives his death a hopeful spin, that they may meet again in the afterlife or some equivalent, but gives no optimistic spin to him choosing the lady, she even mentions the whole if she can't have him no one can.""""",Seminar,Seminar,¬†,,Elaborate,,,,,,

Jealousy can make people do ugly things and mix that in with her pure barbaric nature, it makes sense that she would choose for him to stop living versus living with someone else.

Katherine Bryant,"Hello, here are my thoughts on the two questions. Part 1: Because I believe she does indeed love him, I think that she directs him to the door with the lady. My reasoning is that love would prevent her from being responsible for his death. Part 2: Based on what we know about the king, I think it's likely he would be quite upset and consider putting his own daughter to the same fate as her lover. Her breaking the rules is a huge blow to his ego, and it doesn't seem as though he is the type to let that sort of this slide, even if it's his daughter's life on the line. Plus, if he doesn't apply the same rules to her as the rest of his subjects, the laws his entire kingdom are based upon are at risk. I just don't see him as being able to get past all that, so I think she would face the two doors like everyone else.",,Seminar,,,,,,,,,
