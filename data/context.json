{"Context":"The Lady, or the Tiger? is a story about a semi-barbaric king who uses a unique method for criminal trials: the accused must choose between two doors in an amphitheater; behind one is a tiger, which will kill him if he's guilty, and behind the other is a lady, whom he must marry if he's innocent. A scandal arises when the king's daughter has an affair with a commoner. At his trial, the princess, knowing behind which door each fate lies, signals him to choose one, but the story ends ambiguously without revealing the outcome, leaving it up to the audience to decide: did the princess send her lover to his death, or to another woman's arms? The story intentionally does not reveal what is behind the door the young man chooses. The ending is left ambiguous, inviting the readers to ponder whether the jealous princess directed her lover to the door with the lady, condemning herself to watch him marry another, or to the door with the tiger, sparing herself the pain of his marriage to a rival but condemning him to death.When the King discovers his daughter's affair, he responds by subjecting her lover to the trial of choosing between the two doors. The King's adherence to his own cruel justice system demonstrates his unwavering commitment to the law, even when it involves his own daughter's loved one.â€‹"}
